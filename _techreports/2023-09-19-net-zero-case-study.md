title: ARCHER2 Net Zero Case Study
text: ARCHER2 is the UKâ€™s National HPC service, operated by EPCC, the University of Edinburgh, at the Advanced Computing Facility. ARCHER2 provides an invaluable resource to UK academics to deliver world-class research, including research into the impact of climate change. As part of the wider DRI scoping project, this case study has investigated the emissions associated with ARCHER2 and makes a series of recommendations to move towards Net Zero for large-scale facilities of this type.<br> A detailed analysis of ARCHER2 including its overall energy use, the type of electricity used and how this will impact on the carbon footprint of ARCHER2 over service lifetime, has been conducted.  Also included are investigations into the embedded energy, (e.g. from PAIA or empirical analysis based on area of printed circuits).
