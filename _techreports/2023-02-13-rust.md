title: Emerging Technologies&colon; Rust in HPC
text: This technical report is a short investigation into how Rust could be used for a scientific application in a HPC system. A computational fluid dynamics model of fluid flow into and out of a box was developed in Rust and compared to the same algorithm implemented in C and Fortran. These simulations were performed for both serial and parallelised versions over a variety of problem sizes. The report discusses the results of these simulations and the implications for using Rust as a tool for scientific programming in HPC.
