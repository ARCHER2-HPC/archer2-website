title: Emerging technologies&colon; an AMD MI250X GPU-based platform for HPC applications
text: Supporting AMD MI250X GPU-based platforms for HPC.<br><br>At EPCC, we have experience of providing support to users of NVIDIA V100/A100 GPUs that exist on various Tier-2 HPC systems. However, until now, we have had little knowledge of how to support the use of AMD GPUs, specifically, the AMD Instinct MI200 series of accelerators.<br><br>We felt it was necessary to address this shortcoming given that our Tier-1 HPC system, ARCHER2, is built on AMD processors. Furthermore, the top Cray EX supercomputers available today (Fontier and El Capitan) feature AMD acclerator technology. And so, after gaining access to suitable hardware, we conducted an evaluation exercise in order to assess how easily EPCC support staff could, when dealing with AMD GPUs, undertake typical HPC support activities, such as training, code compilation/debugging and code profiling/benchmarking.<br><br>This details of this evaluation can be found in the attached report.
