  <li>as far as we reasonably can, to provide a 24-hour service as
described at

<h2 id="you-accept">You accept:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>that the service is provided “as is” and we can’t guarantee 100%
perfection. In legal terms, this means that we are excluding all
warranties and conditions applying to the service, including those
implied by law. <a href="what-is-this.html">What is this?</a> We are not liable
if things go wrong and you suffer damage as a result, although if
our negligence results in anyone’s death or personal injury we do
not limit or exclude our liability for that.</li>
  <li>that you are responsible for your use of any advice or information
we may give you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that it’s
true and useful, but we can’t guarantee this. In legal terms, this

representations, statements, conditions or warranties to that or any
other effect except to the extent that such liability may not be
lawfully excluded.</li>
  <li>that we may make changes in the service</li>

your PI if it seems to us that you are breaking these Terms and
Conditions; that if it is necessary to protect the service or other
users’ work or data, we can halt the execution of any program which
you start; and that we have the right to close your accounts</li>
  <li>that you alone are responsible for what you do when using the
service. If you break the law you alone must answer for it, and if
you cause damage to anyone else, you alone are liable, not us</li>
  <li>that you will acquire no intellectual property rights over the
software or any information we provide</li>
  <li>that the use of the service by nationals of certain countries is
controlled by special regulations laid down by the UK Government in
connection with the <a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/index.html">Wassenaar
Arrangement</a></li>
  <li>that we may make reasonable changes to these Terms and Conditions at
any time, and, once we have posted those changes on our website, the
