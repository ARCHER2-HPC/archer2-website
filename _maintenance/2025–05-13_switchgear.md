end_date: 2025-09-15 
quarter: Q3 2025
system: Full ARCHER2 System 
impact: Users will not be able to connect to the login nodes, jobs will not run and users will be unable to access data during this maintenance. There will be no power to the entire site. SAFE and the ARCHER2 website will be available. 
reason: Due to a significant Health and Safety risk, associated with our power supply to the site, that requires action at the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF), there will be a full power outage to the site during this period. Specialised external contractors will be working on a 24/7 basis for the outage period replacing switchgear.
