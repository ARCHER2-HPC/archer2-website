## Technical Assessment Forms

 * [TA form for grant access, fellowship access, Access to HPC calls, Pioneer Project calls](ARCHER2-TA-form.docx)

## Notes on Completing the TA Forms

### Allocation Periods

The total number of CU requested must be broken down into 6-month periods that span the length of access to ARCHER2 that has been requested (e.g. if you have requested 1 year of access in total then the CU must be split into two 6 month periods).

If your application is successful then these period allocations will be enforced on ARCHER2 in the following way:

 * Any unused allocation at the end of a period is lost
 * You cannot usually move CU between different allocation periods

### Scaling Evidence

The number of CU requested and the job sizes must be backed up by quantitative evidence that the code scales efficiently for the problems to be treated to the job sizes requested. The evidence should meet the following requirements:

 * (Required) Table of runtime (or performance) against number of nodes. This should utilise data for the code on ARCHER2 or another HPC system.
 * (Optional) Plot of the runtime or performance against number of nodes using the data provided in the required table to aid interpretation of the code performance and scaling. The performance axis should be plotted on a linear scale, not a log scale.
 * (Optional) Parallel efficiency against number of nodes, again using the code on ARCHER2 or another HPC system. The parallel efficiency axis should be plotted on a linear scale, not a log scale. 
 * For projects planning to make use of a single node (or less) only, please supply a description of the single node performance, rather than the points above.
