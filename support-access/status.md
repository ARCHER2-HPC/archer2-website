### Friday 19th February 1030 ARCHER2 Returned to service

We are pleased to confirm that ARCHER2 is now back in service, following yesterday's maintenance and you may now login and begin running work again.  We have updated the DNS but it appears that users of some ISPs may require some time for their DNS to update. We expect these issues to clear in the next hour or so.

The maintenance was completed successfully and ARCHER2 is now running Version 1.3.3 of the system software, which includes bug fixes and resilience improvements.

During yesterday's maintenance, some users may have been surprised to see their compute jobs begin to run. We apologise for this, it was due to a mistake in the maintenance configuration. Jobs that ran to completion during the maintenance will have been able to write their outputs and close successfully, so the output of such jobs should be valid. However, jobs that were running beyond approximately 10pm last night, will have been deleted when the high-speed network was rebooted, and will need to be resubmitted.

Thank you all for your patience during the maintenance. If you encounter any problems, please contact the [ARCHER2 Service Desk as usual](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/).
