## Current Issues

### Thursday 14th January 2021 09:45

HPE/Cray are investigating another issue on a key backend server on the ARCHER2 4-cabinet service. This is causing instability in running jobs on the system so we have stopped any new jobs starting while investigations take place. We will update you once we have further information. 
We apologise for the inconvenience caused.
