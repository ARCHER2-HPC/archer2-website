### Tuesday 27th April Compute Nodes returned to service 1100 

The ARCHER2 Compute Nodes have now been returned to service and jobs have started to run again.

A new version of the HPE Cray Programming Environment (Version 21.03) has been installed but this is not the default environment.

HPE Cray Programming Environment Version 20.10 remains the default on ARCHER2. If you would like to use the new Programming Environment, instructions on how to enable this can be found at: [https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/dev-environment/](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/dev-environment/)

However, we have noted that this work has caused HPE Cray perftools modules to no longer be available by default. We have provided a workaround for users while we continue to investigate these issues. Details can be found at:
