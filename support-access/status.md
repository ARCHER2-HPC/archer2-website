## Current Issues
### Monday 12th July 2021 10:00 BST 

Over the weekend (started on the evening of Friday 9 July 2021) we have seen some issues with the /work file systems on the ARCHER2 system. These were resolved but since the incident there have been ongoing issues accessing some data from the login nodes. 

We have disabled login access to the system while these issues are investigated with the system vendor (HPE). 

We will provide a further update on this issue by the end of today (Monday 12 July 2021).
