- *alloc*: Nodes running user jobs
- *idle*: Nodes available for user jobs
- *resv*: Nodes in reservation and not available for standard user jobs
- *down*, *drain*, *maint*, *drng*, *comp*: Nodes unavailable for user jobs
- *mix*: Nodes in multiple states 

Note: the long running reservation visible in the plot corresponds to the *short* QoS which
is used to support small, short jobs with fast turnaround time.

## Name change for ARCHER2 4 Cabinet System

The name for the ARCHER2 4 Cabinet service is being changed to **login-4c.archer2.ac.uk** from Wednesday 6th October

This is to allow login.archer2.ac.uk to be used for the full ARCHER2 23 Cabinet service when the service opens. login.archer2.ac.uk will no longer function for the 4 cabinet service so please change to using login-4c.archer2.ac.uk now.

- login-4c.archer2.ac.uk - ARCHER2 4 Cabinet Service 
- login.archer2.ac.uk â€“ Full ARCHER2 Service (when the service opens)
