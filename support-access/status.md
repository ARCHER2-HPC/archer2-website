## Current Issues

#### Monday 8th February 8:00

A powercut affecting a large part of SE Scotland last night has affected machines and hosting services based at our ACF centre. <br>
At present ARCHER2 is unavailable for users to log on. <br>
SAFE is also unavailable so the Service Desk are unable to see or respond to user queries. <br>
Our team are on site and we will provide further updates as soon as possible. <br>
We apologise for this unplanned interruption to service.
