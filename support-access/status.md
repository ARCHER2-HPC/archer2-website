## Known Issues
[Known Issues](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/known-issues/) that our team are working to resolve but which may take some time to fix.


## Current Issues

No current issues. 

## Recently Resolved Issues

### Wednesday 28th July 15:00
There was a power blip in the Edinburgh area at around 1130 today and as a result of this the compute nodes and lustre filesystem experienced issues. 
The HPE team have now restored the compute nodes and the lustre filesystem is available again. 

We apologise for the inconvenience caused by the unplanned issues.  Please report any further problems to the [Service desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) as usual.

## Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

### Wednesday 25th August 1400 - Friday 27th August 1400 

#### Essential Security Maintenance
This maintenenace is to allow HPE to apply an essential security patch to the operating system.  

The queues on the system will start to drain from 1400 on Monday 23rd August to ensure that all running jobs will have completed by the start of the maintenance session.  

Please continue to submit jobs to the batch scheduler and jobs will either run to completion before the start of the maintenance session or if your requested wall time does not allow,  they will run once the service is returned. 

We apologise for the short notice of the maintenance session and any inconvenience caused. 


#### Networking Maintenance
The final phase of the essential network maintenance at the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) will be on Wednesday 25th August. 
We expect this change will involve a momentary loss of external network traffic to the User Access Nodes (UAN) on ARCHER2 which we anticipate will not be noticed by users although it may interrupt file transfers. The work will only affect external communications and jobs running on the compute nodes will not be impacted. 

A user mailing will be sent once the work has been completed. 


## Completed Maintenance Sessions

### Wednesday 18th August 

The networking maintenance has now been completed successfully at the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF). 
We expect the outage will be very short, and will take place between 10:00 and 15:00. 

During this period, your connection to the User Access Node (UAN) may be lost. Please wait a couple of minutes and then try to reconnect. 
File transfers may be affected.

Jobs running on the compute nodes will not be impacted. 

We will send a user mailing once the work is completed.
