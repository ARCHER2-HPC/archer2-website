### Tuesday 29th June 0600 - late evening (TBC)

There will be a full ARCHER2 maintenance session for essential power work at the Advanced Computing Facility. The full shutdown will start on Tuesday 29th June at 0600. We expect the system to be returned on Tuesday 29th June by late evening. Users will be notified once the system is available again. 


### At 1900 Monday 28th June: 
Access to the User Access Nodes (UANs) will be disabled to allow the prepartory work to take place. Any users logged into the system at this time will be logged off and the UANs will be unavailable. Jobs will continue to run until 0600 on Tuesday 29th June and users can submit jobs to the queue ready for the system to return to service.    


### At 0600 Tuesday 29th June:
The compute nodes will be unavailable from 0600. Any jobs that were submitted to the batch will be queued and jobs will start once the system is returned to service.
