Over the weekend (started on the evening of Friday 9 July 2021) we have seen some issues with the /work file systems on the ARCHER2 system. These were resolved but since the incident there have been ongoing issues accessing some data from the login nodes. 

This has now been mitigated by temporarily routing all logins to user access node 02. We hope to bring UAN01 back in to service in due course.
