The HPE team have now restored the compute nodes and the lustre filesystem is available again. 

We apologise for the inconvenience caused by the unplanned issues.  Please report any further problems to the [Service desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) as usual.

We are pleased to confirm that HPE resolved the issues with the interconnect on the ARCHER2 service yesterday evening.  Jobs were restarted and have been running without issues overnight.

## Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

### Wednesday 18th August 

Essential networking work will take place at the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF). 

We expect the outage will be very short, and will take place soon after 10:00. 

During this period, your connection to the User Access Node (UAN) may be lost. Please wait a couple of minutes and then try to reconnect. 

Jobs running on the compute nodes will not be impacted. 

We will send a user mailing once the work is completed.
