<h2> Getting Access </h2>

The ARCHER2 Service is a world-class advanced computing resource for UK researchers. For such researchers, there are specific allocation mechanisms for requesting ARCHER2 time via the ARCHER2 partner research councils EPSRC and NERC as detailed below. For researchers in other areas, please get in touch with your research council if you would like to use ARCHER2.

The ARCHER2 User Support Team are available to offer advice and assistance to any prospective users and can offer guidance as to what is the best route of access ([support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)) or [further contact details can be found here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html).

<!-- A completed Sample Technical Assessment (TA) form can be found here.  -->The ARCHER2 CSE team are happy to provide assistance with completing the forms.

### Other routes to accessing HPC
There are a variety of specialised routes through which researchers can access EPSRC HPC services. EPSRC recommend applicants familiarise themselves with these routes to ensure they apply to the most appropriate one for their project. If you have any questions on the below you can direct them to [researchinfrastructure@epsrc.ukri.org](mailto:researchinfrastructure@epsrc.ukri.org).


#### Grants 
Researchers can request computational time to support their work as part of their full grant applications. 

#### High End Computing (HEC) Consortia
If a researcher's work is within remit of one of the HEC Consortia, formed around research communities with substantial and continuous computational needs, then they can apply for ARCHER2 time by joining the relevant consortium. 

[https://epsrc.ukri.org/research/facilities/hpc/access/highendcomputingconsortia/](https://epsrc.ukri.org/research/facilities/hpc/access/highendcomputingconsortia/)

#### Pioneer Projects
Researchers can apply for large amounts of ARCHER2 compute for ambitious, computationally intensive simulations and calculations in support of an individual project through EPSRC's ARCHER2 Pioneer Projects call.  Projects can be up to 2 years in length.  This is the successor scheme to the ARCHER Leadership Calls.

#### Access to HPC

Provides an open and relatively flexible route to computational support for projects in EPSRC remit.
You can access to EPSRC's HPC systems (both ARCHER2 and most of the Tier-2 services).
Projects can be up to 1 year in length.
This new call combines what was previously the ARCHER RAP (Resource Allocation Panel) and the Tier-2 Open Access call.

#### Pump-priming
Researchers can request a small amount of resource awarded through a light-touch process in order to try, test and scale their code on ARCHER2. This is the successor scheme to ARCHER instant access.


#### Driving test
A small allocation for new ARCHER2 users to get them started using the Tier-1 service.  This scheme will be launched after the service has commenced operation.




### Access for NERC Remit

Details for access routes for NERC Remit researchers will be available soon.







## Onboarding Data Migration

* We have prepared a guide to [Onboarding Data Migration ](onboarding-data-migration)for users whose work is being moved from ARCHER to ARCHER2.
