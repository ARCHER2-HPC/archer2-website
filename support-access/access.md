The ARCHER2 Service is a world-class advanced computing resource for UK researchers. For such researchers, there are specific allocation mechanisms for requesting ARCHER2 time via the ARCHER2 partner research councils EPSRC and NERC as detailed below. For researchers in other areas, please get in touch with your research council if you would like to use ARCHER2.

The ARCHER2 User Support Team are available to offer advice and assistance to any prospective users and can offer guidance as to what is the best route of access ([support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)) or [further contact details can be found here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html).
The ARCHER2 CSE Team can also provide assistance with completing a Technical Assessment (TA)  and can also be contacted via the Service Desk ([support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)).

#### <a name="specific_calls"></a> ARCHER2 Specific Calls: Access to HPC and Pioneer Projects
ARCHER2 specific calls are periodically opened by the research councils. The current calls are listed in the table above. These calls are generally for computing time and storage space only and cannot fund any other expenses.  
##### Access to HPC: 
Provides an open and relatively flexible route to computational support for projects in EPSRC remit.
You can access to EPSRC's HPC systems (both ARCHER2 and most of the Tier-2 services). Projects can be up to 1 year in length. This new call combines what was previously the ARCHER RAP (Resource Allocation Panel) and the Tier-2 Open Access call. It is expected that these calls will open every six months.
##### Pioneer Project: 
EPSRC remit researchers can apply for large amounts of ARCHER2 compute for ambitious, computationally intensive simulations and calculations in support of an individual project through EPSRC's ARCHER2 Pioneer Projects call.  Projects can be up to 2 years in length.  This is the successor scheme to the ARCHER Leadership Calls.

#### <a name="epsrc_grants"></a> Access through EPSRC Grants
On [Je-S,](https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/JeS2WebLoginSite/Login.aspx) access can be requested by choosing ARCHER2 from the drop down list in the _Research Council Facilities_ section for a standard EPSRC grant application. Please add the requested resource in CU as _unit_ and the notional cost in £ as _cost_. Reasonable ARCHER2 allocations are now awarded for the duration of the grant. A completed (<a href="./ta/ARCHER2-TA-form_v1.3.docx">Technical Assessment Form</a>) must be uploaded through Je-S, selecting the document type "Technical Assessment". 

EPSRC operate a 6-monthly allocation period policy for access on ARCHER2. The total number of CPUh (measured on ARCHER2 as the CU) awarded is broken down into 6-month periods that span the length of  access to ARCHER2 that has been requested. Applicants specify the period profile on the TA form when they apply for access.
EPSRC period allcoations are enforced on ARCHER2 in the following way: 
- Any unused allocation at the end of a period is lost  
- You cannot move CU (CPUh) between different allocation periods

#### <a name="nerc_grants"></a> Access through NERC Grants
NERC applicants should also add ARCHER2 as a facility in the standard application, contact the relevant NERC consortia leader and check the current NERC policy on access. Full details are on the [NERC website](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/facilities/hpc/). 
Applicants within the NERC remit wishing to access ARCHER2 via the NERC route must contact the relevant consortia leader for advice. 


#### <a name="ukri_grants"></a>Access through UKRI Grants (non EPSRC and NERC)
For access through UKRI Grants, please complete a <a href="./ta/ARCHER2-TA-form_v1.3.docx">Technical Assessment Form</a>  and submit this to the ARCHER2 Service Desk to
 confirm that the proposal is technically suitable for ARCHER2 and the resources required to include in the grant application. Once this is completed, the ARCHER2 Service Desk will send th
e completed form to EPSRC for approval.
  

#### <a name="other_grants"></a>Access through Grants with other Funding Bodies 
For access through grants with other Funding Bodies, please complete a <a href="./ta/ARCHER2-TA-form_v1.3.docx">Technical Assessment Form</a> and submit this to the ARCHER2 Service Desk to confirm that the proposal is technically suitable for ARCHER2 and the resources required to include in the grant application. Once this is completed, the ARCHER2 Service Desk will send the completed form to EPSRC for approval. 


#### <a name="topup_grant"></a>Grant Top-Up 
Only available for existing EPSRC grant holders with an ARCHER allocation. Provides additional resource for users who already have an allocation from an EPSRC grant, but need more to complete the objectives of their grant. Successor to the ARCHER Top-Up process.


#### <a name="consortia"></a>Access through the EPSRC/NERC Scientific Consortia
If a researcher's work is within remit of one of the Scientific Consortia, formed around research communities with substantial and continuous computational needs, then they can apply for ARCHER2 time by joining the relevant consortium. Each consortium has its own way of applying for access and allocating time. The [ARCHER2 Scientific Consortia](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/research/consortia/) pages have more information on the remit of the individual consortia and their contact details.  


#### <a name="nerc"><ca> Access for NERC Remit
Details for access routes for NERC Remit researchers will be available soon.
Further information is provided on the [NERC HPC page](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/facilities/hpc). 

#### <a name="pump_priming"></a>Pump-priming
EPSRC remit researchers can request a small amount of resource awarded through a light-touch process in order to try, test and scale their code on ARCHER2. This is the successor scheme to ARCHER instant access.

#### <a name="driving_test"></a>Driving test
A small allocation for new ARCHER2 users to get them started using the ARCHER2 Service.  This scheme will be launched after the service has commenced operation and further details will be provided on the [Training Driving Test page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/driving-test.html).

#### <a name="prace"></a>PRACE
##### Guidance on access to PRACE machine for UK scientists
The UK (via EPSRC, STFC and BBSRC) are now paying around £1M a year to be members of PRACE and to get access to the PRACE machines for UK scientists. 
In order to maximise the amount of time obtained, and to help those thinking of applying, the following guidance has been developed by Sylvain Laizet and Debora Sijacki, 
who have had a lot of experience and success in applying to PRACE. Thanks to them for their help. If anyone else would like to add anything based on their experiences, 
please contact the ARCHER2 team [support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)). 

First of all, it may be obvious but it is very important to read all the information on the [PRACE website](https://prace-ri.eu/). The main sources of information are the User documentation pages and the Best practice guides on the PRACE website. Make yourself aware of how to apply and what the application procedures are. You might have to apply several time before being successful. The good thing is that you will be able to use the feedback from the referees to improve your application.

You need to see a PRACE proposal in a similar way as a full RCUK proposal. Do not wait until the last minute to write your proposal. Make sure that your colleagues read it and give you valuable feedback. The scientific aspect is of crucial importance. You will need to demonstrate novelty, impact and timeliness. This is the most important part of the proposal.

Building a good team with EU partners is essential (each member of the team needs to have a specific expertise). Your experience of using HPC resources in the past and how you will manage using a Tier-0 system are also very important. It is worth emphasizing if the simulation data have a legacy value: what will be shared with the scientific community and how.

Aim for big but it is important to check how much resources are available on a given system (might be risky to ask for > 40%-50% of the system's core hours). You must aim for simulations that can only be performed on Tier 0 Systems, not on Tier 1 Systems.

You will need to produce scalability plots and representative benchmarks. If you do not have representative benchmarks and data to justify the resource request you need to apply for a Preparatory Project (http://www.prace-ri.eu/prace-preparatory-access/), which allows you to port your code, to test it, and to collect all the information necessary for a full proposal.

It is important to have a detailed plan of when/how the simulations will be setup/run/data copied/stored and what are the RAM/I/O/storage requirements at any given stage. Also have a detailed project management plan: who will do what in the collaboration, how data will be shared, meeting/telecon schedule, plans for paper writing, project webpage etc.

PRACE calls are advertised on the [PRACE website](https://prace-ri.eu/).
