The ARCHER2 Service Desk is the first point of contact for all questions relating to the ARCHER2 Service. Support is available Monday to Friday from 08:00 until 18:00 UK time, excluding UK public holidays. The ARCHER2 Service Desk can be reached by:

- [Email support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)
- [Via the SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/)
- Telephone: +44 (0)131 650 5000 (if the above number is unavailable, please use +44 (0)131 618 8313)
- By post, to:

> ARCHER2 Service Desk  
EPCC  
Bayes Centre  
47 Potterrow  
Edinburgh EH8 9BT

Please try and provide as much background information as possible as this will speed up the processing time considerably. Existing ARCHER2 users will be asked for their user ID, project code, and, where applicable, the commands they are using and the error message they get. In order to investigate issues, we may ask you to share data (e.g. source code, job scripts, input data) with us. Information on how to share data with us [can be found in the ARCHER2 documentation](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/data/#sharing-data-with-all-archer2-users).

For more complex queries a callback may be booked to discuss your issue with an EPCC expert at a time of your convenience. This may be done via Zoom or telephone.

## How the Service Desk ticket system works

When a query is submitted by email or through the SAFE, it is placed in the SAFE query system. Phone queries are entered into the system by the Service Desk operator.

When you email your query, you will normally get an automatic acknowledgement by email, including a tracking ID, within a few minutes. If you submit your query through SAFE, it will give you a tracking ID at once. A few minutes later, your query will be assigned to the appropriate expert within the ARCHER2 team to handle.

The expert may contact you to discuss your problem or to get extra information. Finally, the expert will send you an answer, and the query will be closed. At this point the Service Desk will send you another message, telling you that this has happened.

Closed queries are kept in the SAFE database, so that we can refer back to them when solving future problems, and when writing documentation, etc. The SAFE database is protected by [ARCHER2 Personal Data and Privacy Policy](../about/policies/privacy.html).
