title: Turbulent Jet-Flow.
name: Mr Patrick Bechlars
institution: University of Southampton / Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics Group
description: A turbulent pipe-flow is shown exiting into a co-flow and developing a turbulent jet. Turbulent structures, visualised as iso-surfaces of a vortex identification criterion, are coloured with the stream-wise velocity. The windows show magnifications of different regions in the flow. The turbulent jet is a canonical flow mimicking effects found in engineering applications such as, e.g., propulsion jets of aircraft engines. The flow data were produced by direct numerical simulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations using the UK national high performance computing facility ARCHER. These data provide insight into the fundamental dynamics of turbulent flows and to jet-noise reducing techniques. Turbulence describes the chaotic behaviour a flow can develop and is one of the most important unsolved problems of classical physics. Simulated data of turbulent flows, acquired on ARCHER, are a backbone of a better understanding of the chaos in flows.
