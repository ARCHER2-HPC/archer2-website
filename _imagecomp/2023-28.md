title: Animation of a three-dimensional simulation of Rayleigh-Taylor convection using the Elliptical Parcel-in-Cell method. 
description: We have developed a three-dimensional model to simulate fluid dynamics using ellipsoidal parcels.These parcels can deform, split and merge to capture the effects of mixing on the flow. <br> The simulation shown here starts with a warm fluid below a cold fluid. This unstable stratification leads to the development of a convective, turbulent flow. The animation shows the buoyancy field and the vertical component of vorticity. The line plots show the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy (left) and the enstrophy (right, this gives a measure of dissipation of kinetic energy).
