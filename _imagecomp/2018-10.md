title: A Nanoparticle Walks into a Tumour (and Other Biomedical Challenges)&colon; Towards a Morphology, Size, and Shape of Perfect Anti-Cancer Agents
name: Barbara Farkas
institution: School of Chemistry, Cardiff University
description:  Nanotechnology has revolutionised cancer treatment in the last decade due to the unique properties packed in the nanosized features. Small sizes that are at the very limit of invisible, however, brought big challenges to experimentalists. The ability to investigate substances at the atomic level using supercomputers as ARCHER has boosted both the analysis of compounds that were expected to perform good as well as the search for new materials with outstanding properties for use in the biomedicine.<br><br>This image shows the journey that starts with a cobalt nanoparticle, made of highly magnetic but toxic metal and as such would never be considered a good candidate for the cancer therapy, carries on with its modification with gold coating and functionalisation with biomolecules, just to terminate with a multimodal nanocomposite that has both biocompatibility and power to fight the malignant disease. And all of that thanks to the almighty engine of ARCHER machines.
