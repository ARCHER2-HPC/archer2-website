title: Growth of hair around a Black Hole
name: Llibert Aresté Saló
institution: Centre for Geometry, Analysis and Gravitation, School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London
description: Time evolution of the scalar field (hair) that grows around the remnant Black Hole formed after the merger of two Black Holes in a given modified theory of gravity. This class of theories are of particular interest since they violate the no-hair theorem that applies in General Relativity.
