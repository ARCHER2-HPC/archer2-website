title: Spiral vortices in photoelectron momentum distributions
name: Gregory Armstrong
institution: Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Queen's University Belfast
description: The image shows the photoelectron momentum distribution obtained following irradiation of the potassium atom by two counter-rotating circularly-polarized infrared laser pulses. Such pulses induce interference between photoelectron wavepackets which is manifest in the form of spiral vortices in the momentum distribution. Here the inner spiral feature arises from the absorption of three photons from each of the two laser pulses. The opposing helicity of these pulses creates a six-arm spiral interference pattern. The outer spiral feature is the signature of an additional photon absorption from each pulse, resulting in an eight-arm spiral vortex.<br><br>The calculations were performed on ARCHER using the R-matrix with time-dependence (RMT) codes, which treat interactions between multi-electron atoms and molecules with laser fields of arbitrary polarization.
