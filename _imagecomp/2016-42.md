title: 3D photo-electron momentum distribution after photo-ionisation of hydrogen molecular ion with an ultra-short XUV laser pulse.
name: Mr. Alejandro de la Calle
institution: Atomistic Simulation Centre, School of Mathematics and Physics. Queen's University Belfast
description:  3D Momentum distribution of ejected electron from hydrogen molecular ion after interaction with an ultra-short XUV laser pulse. Absorption of one photon produces a spherical distribution centred at the origin with radius the momentum of the ionised electron. The ejected electron energy is given by the energy of the incident photon minus the ionisation potential of the molecule. The node along the z axis is due to initial state of the molecule. Calcualtions of the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation in full dimensions required the computational capabilities of ARCHER.<br />		The circular structures with their centres along the central axis are due to rescattering of the electron against one of the two parent nucleus. The energy that the electron has gained from the field after ionisation allows for probing the structure and dynamics of the parent system. For example, electron emission in a diatomic molecule as the hydrogen molecular ion presents two-center interference, the same kind of intereference present in a double-slit experiment. The data was obtained solving the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation on a massively parallel calculation on the ARCHER supercomputer.
