title: Dramatic ionization from the nitrogen dimer during ultrafast laser irradiation
description: Using the ARCHER2 compute capabilities, we have carried out precision calculations to ascertain the behavior of a Nitrogen molecule subject to intense laser fields, on a timescale on the order of femtoseconds. In these calculations, we directly calculate the motion of the electrons in the molecule. The resulting density of charge for each electron in the system can then be visualized using modern rendering techniques, originally developed for the film industry by DreamWorks, and also rendered using ARCHER2 compute. Here, charge associated with two of the electrons are rendered in red and blue. Such pure and intense irradiation, over such short timescales, is not seen in nature, so the visualisations are a testament to humanity's recent progress on both laser and computer technologies, and our deepening understanding of quantum processes.
