title: Hydrogen partitioning during Earth's core-mantle differentiation
name: Dr Li Yunguo
institution: University College London
description:  The ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories of hydrogen shows that most hydrogen atoms will be partitioned into the core materials at conditions simulating the Earth's core-mantle differentiation process. This simulation clearly demonstrates the siderophile ("iron-loving") nature of hydrogen, and implies that the Earth's core can be a reservoir of hydrogen.
