title: Conformation of endothelial glycocalyx under physiological flow conditions
name: Dr Xizhuo Jiang
institution:  University College London, Department of Mechanical Engineering
description:  This image shows the conformation of the endothelial glycocalyx under physiological flow conditions. The the research, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are constructed to investigate microvascular ion transport through the endothelial glycocalyx layer. Results show that the stretching conformation of the endothelial glycocalyx facilitates sodium ion transport, thereby influence extracellular water balance. The research has contributed to an 8% increase in accuracy of the osmotic part of the Starling's principle (1896), a principle that is taught to generations of students of physiology to estimate extracellular water balance but always overestimates results. Implementation on Archer enables this research to stand at the very forefront of molecular dynamics studies for biomolecular systems.<br />The original image was generated by VMD, and was modified by Adobe Illustrator by adding a Bas Relief sketch effect.
