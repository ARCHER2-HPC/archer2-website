title: Oxidisation Damage to Graphene
name: Robert Sinclair
institution: Department of Chemistry, University College London
description: Oxidising a graphene sheet introduces new chemical groups to a previously pristine carbon honeycomb structure. Oxidised 'islands' appear in the oxidisation process (shown in green), that buckle the flake and make it more flexible. Depending on the degree of oxidisation, undamaged graphene can remain (shown in blue) which allows some of graphene's superlative properties to persist, like its conductivity and high strength.<br />		ARCHER was used to develop a new force-field for simulating graphene structures on an atomic scale. This allowed an accurate description of the friction between graphene sheets, with the aim of better understanding the notoriously difficult process of exfoliating graphene in solution.
