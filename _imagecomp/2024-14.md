title: Large-eddy simulation of a diurnal cycle of the urban boundary layer over London
description: Earth's atmosphere goes through daily cycles due to the surface being heated by the sun during the day and releasing stored energy at night. This video shows a 3-hour period in the early afternoon, taken from a 24-hour simulation of the atmosphere up to 1 km above central London. The tall building visible is the BT tower, giving a sense of scale to the air flow, which is modelled down to a resolution of 2 metres. The visualisation shows how air temperature varies, adjusted for the fact that pressure decreases with height. The behaviour is dynamic and complex; as the surface heats up, warm air rises, creating a turbulent lower layer that grows and mixes with the calmer air above. High-resolution simulations like this are essential for studying how the built environment interacts with the local climate, helping to make cities more resilient, sustainable and adaptive to future environmental challenges.
