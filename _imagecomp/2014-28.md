title: Exploring the Activation Mechanisms of an Insect Neuroreceptor
name: Mr Federico Comitani
institution: King's College London, Department of Physics
description:  Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are important neuroreceptors that mediate the fast communication between neurons by allowing ions to pass across the cell membrane in response to the binding of a small molecule, the neurotransmitter. Their malfunction is linked to serious neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and they are major drug target; in insects they are involved in insecticide resistance. Using a novel computational technique for accelerating rare events, "funnel metadynamics", we simulated binding and unbinding events of the neurotransmitter GABA to the fruit fly RDL receptor&colon; the part of this system containing the binding site is shown in blue. The orange funnel represents a restraining potential that restricts the exploration of GABA in the solvent outside the protein, allowing for accurate estimations of the energy of binding. Sequential snapshots of GABA, coloured from red to violet, suggest a possible unbinding path. The image was generated with VMD v1.9.2.
