title: Late-time drop breakup interacting with uniform surrounding airflows

description: We conduct high-resolution direct numerical simulations investigating the deformation and breakup of liquid drops interacting with uniform ambient airflows. The morphology of the drop before its breakup is governed by a competition between inertial and capillary forces; and in our regime of interest, the droplet deforms into a thin bag film attached to a toroidal rim. A recently developed numerical algorithm is applied to artificially create holes on the thin bag film and initiate its fragmentation, so that the resulting liquid drop statistics are not dependent on the grid size. The image shows the film breakup process with this algorithm applied, where one can observe the expansion of holes on the film, the formation of liquid ligaments following the merge two hole rims, and the subsequent breakup of the ligaments producing droplets with different sizes, which often experience shape oscillations.
