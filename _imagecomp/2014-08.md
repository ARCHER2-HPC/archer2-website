description:  The study of dynamic processes in catalysis and materials chemistry using accurate quantum mechanical calculations is a computationally demanding process. The high performance computing resources offered by ARCHER through the Materials Chemistry Consortium are pivotal for the performance of such calculations. In this study we explore through hybrid-DFT molecular dynamics simulations the spatial and time evolution of adsorbates on the surface of nanoclusters. This research has resulted in fascinating simulations with respect to the dynamic motion of adsorbates on the surface of nanoparticles at high coverages.
