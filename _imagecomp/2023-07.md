title: Oil into a ketton carbonate rock saturated with water
name: Dr Liang Yang
institution: Cranfield University, Energy and Sustainability
description: This simulated a pure injection drainage process with a non-wetting phase using the Open-source Taichi-LBM3D code for the Ketton carbonate, supported by the eCSE Archer2 grant&colon; 'MPI implementation of open-source fully-differentiable multiphase lattice Boltzmann code'. The simulation domain measures 250^3. Excluding the inlet layer, which was initially saturated with oil, the sample was completely saturated with water (the wetting phase). Despite the high capillary pressure, some small pores and throats were not filled with the non-wetting phase. The simulation was performed using Archer2 computational resources and post-processed with Paraview.
