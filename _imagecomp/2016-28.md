title: A "Pac-enzyme" in action&colon; thermodynamics analysis of domain motion.
name: Dr. Danilo Roccatano
institution: School of Maths and Physics, University of Lincoln
description:  Our pac-enzyme, Citrate Synthase (CS) is an enzyme localized in the mitochondria of our cells where it plays an important role in the aerobic respiration cycle by transforming oxaloacetate molecules (on the right side of the picture) in citrate (on the top left side) with the assistance of the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) molecule. As the pac-man in the famous computer game, this Pac-enzyme diffuses along the space between the convolute cristae (the convoluted inner membrane) of the mitochondria "chomping" at encountered oxaloacetates. This activates the enzyme to bind the CoA (ghosts in the playground). For each captured CoA, a new citrate molecule is then produced (score). This complex mechanism requires large conformation changes of parts of the protein (domains) whose molecular details are not yet clarified. Using molecular dynamics simulations on the ARCHER supercomputer, we are studying this enzyme to garner novel insights on structural, dynamics and thermodynamics of its functional mechanisms.
