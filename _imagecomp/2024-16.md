title: A 'shaking' droplet&colon; mapping lithium atom trajectory
description: This image depicts a slice of a 'shaking' droplet, showing large fluctuations due to atom motion and gas release during the droplet explosion. We conducted reactive molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS to visualize the atom dynamics within the droplet on ARCHER2. The streamline in this image represents the trajectory of lithium atoms over 1 femtosecond, demonstrating rigorous motion of lithium atoms during the explosion. This image was generated using Ovitio post-processing software.
