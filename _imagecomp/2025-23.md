title: Vortices in motion&colon; the hidden dynamics of a pitching forward swept wing
description: The video reveals the vortical evolution around a 30 degree forward swept wing that sinusoidally pitches in the laminar flow regime. The animation displays the low-speed air interacting with the wing from the front, side and top view, bringing to life the complex three-dimensional nature of unsteady aerodynamics. Iso-surfaces of the Q-criterion coloured by spanwise vorticity identify the formation and breakdown of coherent vortical structures. The simulation was carried out using the finite volume Navier-Stokes solver within OpenFOAM on the ARCHER2 HPC system. Workload distribution via the scotch domain decomposition method enabled efficient use of large numbers of CPUs, reducing the extensive computational cost.  Such simulations, challenging to replicate experimentally, provide valuable insight into wake development and vortex interactions, with applications to future low-speed aircraft design and nature-inspired flight used in for low-speed applications. ARCHER2 enables the simulations to run at a scale and speed impossible for normal high-end computers.
