title: Turbulence structure in a supersonic mixing layer
name: Dr Jian Fang
institution: Scientific Computing Department, STFC Daresbury Laboratory
description:  The animation shows the turbulence coherent structures in a supersonic mixing layer. The turbulence is created in the shear layer between two high Mach number flows. The speed of the flow is so high that shocklets are generated due to the turbulence compressibility, and we see how the unsteady interaction between shocklets and vortical structure. The turbulence coherent structures are visualised with the iso-surfaces of swirling strength and coloured with streamwise vorticity. The shocklets are represented with the gradient of pressure. The results were obtained using ASTR code and the computing time is awarded by UKTC.
