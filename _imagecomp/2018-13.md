title: Hypersaline sea surface release and propagation under tidal conditions in the northern North Sea
name: Pierre Cazenave
institution: Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Marine Ecosystem Modelling and Prediction
description:  A hypersaline point source is set up within an FVCOM model of a region in the northern North Sea. The very salty water is denser than its surroundings and so plummets to the sea bed in a single narrow column. Once at the bottom of the sea, the tides moves and mixes the salty water making it spread around the seabed, until it is mixed to the point it is indistinguishable from the rest of the water in the North Sea.
