title: Imaging the source of great Tsunami earthquakes (Subduction of the Pacific Plate below the Australian Plate)
name: Dr Richard Davy
institution: Imperial College London, Department of Earth Science and Engineering.
description: This image shows the subduction of the Pacific Plate below the Australian Plate, forming New Zealandâ€™s North Island. This subduction zone produces a wide range of earthquakes, some with the ability to generate dangerous Tsunami, and others that slip by unnoticed by humans. We produced models and images of this subduction zone using ARCHER2, to help us further understand what is controlling these earthquakes. In this image, we can see seismic velocities (indicated by colours) overlying the imaged fault structure of the subduction zone (greyscale image). Interestingly, we observe low velocities on the main fault (which dips down to the left) that separates the two tectonic plates. We interpret these low velocities to indicate the presence of fluids that would facilitate long and slow earthquakes, while the presence of submarine mountains (such as the one imaged on the right edge of the coloured zone) would promote large Tsunami earthquakes.
