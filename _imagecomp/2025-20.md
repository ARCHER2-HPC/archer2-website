title: Deep Impact
description: This rendering illustrates a 3D discrete element method (DEM) simulation performed with the MFIX-DEM solver on the ARCHER2 high-performance computing facility and visualized in ParaView with the OSPRay path tracer, capturing the fleeting complexity of transient granular flow. A single impactor—ten times larger than the background grains—strikes a bed of 1.1 million particles at 100 m/s.<br><br>On the left, particles are coloured by velocity, revealing the granular shockwave that propagates radially through the particulate assembly, compressing and dilating the mixture as it dissipates into the medium. On the right, the evolving contact network traces the hidden skeleton of force&colon; braided chains of compression and fragile links of tension. These filaments illustrate how momentum impacts the bed's structure, and how structure in turn governs failure or resistance.<br><br>Together, the velocity field and the contact force network reveal the transient choreography upon this deep impact.
