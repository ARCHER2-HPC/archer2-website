title: Artistic representation of an atom-by-atom  building process of 3D nanostructures using purely  the mechanical forces of an atomic force microscope (AFM)  and atomically sharp  tips. The material is GaAs.
name: David Abbasi Perez
institution: King's College London, Department of Physics
description:  This  is an artistic representation that shows an oscillating atomically sharp tip capable of picking and dropping vertically  either gallium or arsenic atoms indistinctly in a reversible way in order to build 3D nanorods, using purely mechanical forces. This tip could be seen as an atomic crane, which ultimate objective will be create 3D nanostructures  on a GaAs surface. The tip, at the top right part of the image, is an oscillating atomic force microscopy tip,  and the vertical columns are the hypothetical nanorods we  would like to build, if  possible. Calculations run on Archer so far have shown that the reversible picking and deposition process of single atoms using purely mechanical forces is possible. The image has been generated using mainly  Blender  and The Gimp open software codes.
