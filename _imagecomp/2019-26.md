title: X23 set of molecular crystals geometry studied with RSCAN functional in CASTEP
name:  Miss Yue Wang
institution: University of Oxford, Materials
description:  Molecular crystals are often more difficult to study compared to covalent crystals due to their long range interatomic forces. CASTEP is an ab initio software that predicts ground state properties of periodic structures using Density Functional Theory. A recently implemented functional to help better predict gound state lattice parameters/structure is tested on a benchmark data set of 23 molecular crystals.<br> Archer is the best service to use for these high throughput calculations using CASTEP and the resulting structures' optimised geometries are shown in the figure (plotted using VESTA), arranged in the letters "ARCHER".
