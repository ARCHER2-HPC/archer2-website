title: Flow and structure of the Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctica
name: Dr Martin O'Leary
institution: University of Swansea, Department of Geography
description:  The Larsen C ice shelf is an area of floating glacial ice in Antarctica, roughly two and a half times the size of Wales. A changing  climate has caused temperatures in this part of Antarctica to rise greatly over the past few decades, which has allowed meltwater to  seep into the ice, warming it and changing its material properties. Similar processes have already caused the collapse of the Larsen  A and B ice shelves. If Larsen C were to collapse, nearby glaciers would accelerate and thin, leading to a large contribution to sea level rise.<br /><br />This image illustrates a band of ice flow originating in Cabinet Inlet, where field and satellite observations have found large meltwater ponds. Using high-resolution numerical modelling on ARCHER, we are able to map how ice from this area is transported through the ice shelf, and determine its future effects on the stability of Larsen C.
