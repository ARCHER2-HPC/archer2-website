title: Model of EphA2 ectodomain at the membrane
name:  Dr Matthieu Chavent and Mr Tom Newport
institution: SBCB, Biochemistry Department, University of Oxford
description:  Model of the ectodomain of the EphA2 receptor interacting with a lipid bilayer (here represented by triangles or cubes). Multi-scale simulations based on this model reveal the flexibility of the ectodomain. The image illustrates the simulated dynamics of the ectodomain (shown as glowing lines) as well as different conformations that highlight the possible movement of this receptor relative to the membrane surface.
