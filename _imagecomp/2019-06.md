title: Cavitation bubble collapse
name:  Mr Duncan Dockar
institution: University of Edinburgh, School of Engineering
description:  Cavitation is the phenomenon where a bubble can spontaneously form within a liquid due to a local reduction in pressure. When these cavitation bubbles collapse, they release a high-speed liquid jet which can result in pitting of the nearby solid surface. This can be a major problem where the repeated formation and collapse of cavitation bubbles over many thousands of cycles can cause significant structural damage, particularly in turbomachinery. However, at the nano- to micro-scale there are potentially beneficial applications for cavitation, such as the cleaning of high-precision micro-electronic sensors. <br> Our Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation shows the jet formed from a collapsing cavitation bubble subjected to a shock wave, and the resulting damage to the nearby silicon substrate. We hope this research will further understanding of how pitting occurs in solids, and the conditions to reduce the effects of cavitation erosion.
