title: Particle trajectories in a high resolution simulation of the Southern Ocean
name: Dr Andrew Coward
institution: National Oceanography Centre/ Marine System Modelling
description: The Natural Environment Research Council maintains a high resolution global ocean modelling capability on the ARCHER service. Results from these simulations are used in a wide variety of scientific applications and national and international collaborations. Here we show a selection of trajectories for simulated particles released into the model's Southern Ocean. This work was part of a study into the feasibility of sequesting and storing carbon dioxide in the deep ocean and uses a technique capable of tracking hundreds of thousands of particles over century long timescales. Each trajectory is coloured with the time since release and is displayed over a 3D representation of the model bathymetry (in grayscale). The smaller, inset, image shows an example of the instantaneous surface current speed which illustrates the typical currents in the region.
