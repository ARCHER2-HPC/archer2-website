title: Coverage-dependent IR simualtions of CO adsorption on a palladium nanoparticle
name: Dr Constantinos Zeinalipour-Yazdi
institution: University College London, Department of Chemistry
description:  Spectroscopic techniques such as infrared absorption or transmission spectroscopy can yield quantitative and qualitative  information about the structure of nanomaterials used in catalysis. In this computational study we have used ARCHER resources  to establish a general framework for IR simulations of nanoparticles obtained during the adsorption  of CO as  a function of  coverage. This research was featured in a recent article published in Surface Science with collaborating research groups from  Cardiff, Birmingham and London.
