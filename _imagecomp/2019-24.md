title: Bacterial cell envelope computational model in a drawing style.
name: Dr. Conrado Pedebos
institution: School of Chemistry, University of Southampton
description: The image shows a snapshot of a model of the bacterial cell envelope, which captures the complexity of such structure, containing two membranes, several proteins, antibiotic molecules, water and ions. The image was rendered in a drawing style based on the work of David Goodsell. The aim of this research project is to understand how the antibiotic molecules attach and diffuse inside the bacterial cell, trying to bring new insights that could aid the development of better drugs. ARCHER's large computational power allowed us to perform biomolecular simulations of such a complex and huge molecular system.
