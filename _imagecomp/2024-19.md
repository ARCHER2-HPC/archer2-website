title: Growth of Hexagonal Boron Nitride
description: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can be synthesised via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of borazine (B<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) on a ruthenium surface. The growth process, intermediates and resulting structures depend highly on temperature and precursor exposure. We developed a first-principles microkinetic model that accurately predicts the temperature dependence of hBN growth from initial adsorption to nanoporous intermediates and final overlayer. Adsorption at low temperatures (green) is followed by sequential partial dehydrogenation (purple/blue) and diffusion with increasing temperature. Sufficient exposure leads to dimerisation and then polymerisation into nanoporous intermediates (red), while excess exposure results in disordered phases (grey). Complete dehydrogenation at high temperatures leads to hBN formation (yellow). The model aligns with experimental data, providing insights into atomic structure and synthesis. The animation was created using structures calculated from Density Functional Theory via CASTEP on ARCHER2 (excluding the inferred disordered phase) before combination and animation in Blender to highlight each phase.
