title: Particles surf on plasma waves excited by high-power lasers
name: Nitin Shukla
institution: Instituto Superior Technico
description: Particle accelerators are fundamental tools for science and society, enabling scientific discoveries and providing 				 unprecedented insights into fundamental propterties of nature. Miniaturization of those machines would open the way 				 to several applications, from light sources to cancer treatments. Laser wakefield acceleration is a promising candidate 				 to achieve what is called a table-top electron accelerator. The idea is to use a powerful laser to excite a wave in a plasma, 				 an ionized gas and exploit the strong accelerating fields of the wave to accelerate electrons. The picture depicts a laser 				 pulse (in color) causing a strong modulation in the plasma density (in blue) and thus driving the plasma wave. An 				 electron beam (witness bunch, in orange) is injected ito the latter and gets accelerated. The simulation has been performed with 				 the Particle-In-Cell code OSIRIS on ARCHER in the framework of the HPC-Europa3 program.
