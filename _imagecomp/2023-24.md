title: Bulk simulated Phosphate-based bioglass by developed ReaxFF potential
description: Phosphate-based glasses (PBGs) have different applications based on their dissolution properties which can be tuned over several orders of magnitude via their composition targeting the desired application. The ReaxFF forcefield can describe the formation and dissociation of chemical bonds during molecular dynamics simulation. We developed ReaxFF parameters of ternary PBGs which include the interaction between phosphorus and calcium atoms, as these are the compositions used in biomedical applications. Optimization of the parameters has been done against a large training set of quantum mechanical data, mostly from small boxes of the phosphate glasses using ARCHER2. The developed ReaxFF parameters can describe structural properties of both binary and ternary glass compositions which are consistent with the experimental results.
