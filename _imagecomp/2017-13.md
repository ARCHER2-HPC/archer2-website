title: Self assembling peptide nanocage
name: Richard Sessions
institution: University of Bristol
description:  This video introduces the simplest model for the self-assembling peptide nanocage or SAGE. The assembly is comprised of simple coiled coil (hub) units each composed of homotrimeric helices, each attached via a disulphide bond to either negatively or positively charged peptides. The acidic or basic hub units are synthesized separately. When mixed together, the oppositely charged peptides dimerize to form coiled coil heterodimers. This drives spontaneous polymerization which produces spherical structures 80-100 nm in diameter. This was unexpected for a predominantly hexagonal (therefore, flat) lattice. Experimental and modeling evidence (atomistic and coarse-grained) suggests that this modular arrangement permits sufficient defects in the hexagonal lattice to allow sphere closure, satisfying the drive to bury hydrophobic residues from the aqueous environment.
