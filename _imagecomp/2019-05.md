title: Turbulence-resolving simulations of a utility-scale offshore wind farm, highlighting the flow structures and turbulence of turbine wakes
name: Dr Georgios Deskos
institution: Imperial College London
description:  Coherent (vortical) structures of utility-scale offshore wind turbine wakes, interacting with each other and the ambient atmospheric turbulence.The present simulation was performed on ARCHER using the high-fidelity, high scalability wind farm simulator, WInc3D. The wind turbines are modelled using an enhanced actuator line model. Photos are not enhanced.
