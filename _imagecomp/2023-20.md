title: Exploring the Impact of Electrogram Data Analysis at Different Spatial Resolutions in Models of Atrial Fibrillation.
name: Carlos Edgar Lopez Barrera
institution: Queen Mary University of London, SEMS
description: This image illustrates a study on clinical measurement locations' impact on understanding and treating diseases, including irregular heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation (AF). The spatial resolution of AF electrogram data is crucial for interpreting the underlying AF mechanism and successfully treating AF. We investigated this through simulating AF electrogram recordings at different spatial resolutions
