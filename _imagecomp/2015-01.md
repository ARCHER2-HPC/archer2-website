title: Crystal Structure of Solid Hydrogen.
name: Dr Sam Azadi
institution: Imperial College London
description:  If hydrogen gas is compressed, it solidifies to form a crystal of H2 molecules - the simplest and most fundamental of all  molecular crystals. As the pressure is increased the crystal of hydrogen undergoes several phase transitions, but  hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays so weakly that the structures of the new phases are unknown. This photo illustrates a  crystal structure of solid hydrogen which is predicted by theoretical and computational methods. Eventually, at high enough  pressures, hydrogen is predicted to become not only a metallic atomic solid (believed present in large quantities in the  interiors of Saturn and Jupiter) but also a high-temperature superconductor and perhaps a superfluid. How does crystalline  hydrogen progress from an insulating molecular solid to a metallic monatomic solid as the pressure is increased? This  question has been with us since 1935 but remains unanswered&colon; it is no exaggeration to say that it is the central preoccupation of high-pressure physics.
