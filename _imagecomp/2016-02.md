title: Electric field response of multilayer graphene systems under different voltages.
name: Dr Elton Santos
institution: Queen's University Belfast
description:  Electric response of multilayer graphene at different values of field. One of the main implications of this response 		 is that the dielectric constant of graphene is not constant but is tunable with an electric bias. This means that some		  fundamental quantities, as for instance the electron-electron interactions, can be controlled using an external parameter.
