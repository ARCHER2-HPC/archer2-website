title: Turbulent lean hydrogen premixed flame
description: This image shows the heat release rate and vorticity in a simulated three-dimensional turbulent lean hydrogen premixed flame under gas-turbine conditions. The left image represents a 2D slice of the vorticity (grey scale) and heat release on a flame surface (colours) and the right image represents the heat release on the same surface in 3D. Because hydrogen is very light, it behaves differently from carbon-based fuels. One important difference is that combustion instabilities emerge in hydrogen flames. We therefore investigate how such instabilities influence the turbulent flame behaviour in conditions close to operating gas-turbines. Understanding this process is crucial for advancing hydrogen as a clean alternative to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, since it strongly affects the flame dynamics and has a direct impact on safety and efficiency in combustion systems. This simulation was performed on ARCHER2.
