title: The shining stars of turbulence
description: This image captures the transformation of a two-dimensional-like shear layer, depicting its journey starting from structured order. Initially, the shear layer appears as an elongated singular shape, but as it undergoes in-viscid fragmentation, it breaks down into smaller sizes, where dissipation levels are present leading into what is known as fully developed turbulence. The bright contrasting contours in the image showcases the levels of linkage between different length scales in the flow. The present simulation was obtained with the parallel code Pantarhei on Archer2, which enable us to reveal new flow physics with the accuracy that is needed.
