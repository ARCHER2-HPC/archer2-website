title: Unsteady Evolution of Leading-Edge Vortices from a Covert-Inspired Flexible Flap
description: This image depicts how a covert-inspired flexible flap dynamically interacts with the unsteady leading-edge vortex shedding from a wing section in stalled condition, augmenting the aerodynamic lift force. The incompressible laminar flow is simulated using finite-volume method (OpenFOAM) and the hyper-elastic flexible flap deformation is solved using finite-element analysis (Calculix) on Archer2 HPC system. The fluid and structural counterparts are coupled using a partitioned strong coupling approach. Two coherent vortex structures are seen to convect from the leading-edge, emerging from the coupled fluid-structure interaction of the flexible flap. The flow-field is visualised in terms of the negative finite-time Lyapunov exponent ridges, representing the unstable manifolds of this higher-order dynamical system. This image highlights the role of passive flow-induced vibration of the bio-inspired flap that underlines the effective flow control, in turn, enhancement of the aerodynamic efficiency by mitigating the effect of flow separation due to the stall phenomenon.
