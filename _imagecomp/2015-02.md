title: Crystal Structure of Solid Benzene.
name: Dr Sam Azadi
institution: Imperial College London
description: Molecular crystals, including organic and inorganic, play vital role in understanding the physics and chemistry of the Earth  and planets. Low-Z molecular systems are among the most abundant in the solar system, as represented by planetary gases and ices.  Their behaviour at high pressures is crucial for modelling the structure, dynamic and evolution of the large planets. More over,  compression of molecular systems provides the opportunity of forming new materials, possibly with novel properties such as high-temperature  superconductivity, disordered and amorphous materials, and superhardness structures. This photograph shows the crystal structure of  solid benzene which is the simplest organic molecular solid. Crystalline benzene phase diagram is a big challenge for theoretical and  computational methods. To distinguish between crystal phases and competing low-energy polymorphs, the lattice energy calculations require very high accuracy.
