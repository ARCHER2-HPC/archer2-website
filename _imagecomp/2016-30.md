title: Multiscale modelling of ventricular tachycardia
name: Mr. Hector Martinez-Navarro
institution: Computational Cardiovascular Science group, University of Oxford
description:  Meshes extracted from CT scannings are taken as basis for simulating the cardiac electrophysiology.<br />  It has been taken into consideration the heterogeneity of tissue inside the human torso, which is needed for measuring the electric potential on the body surface and computing the electrocardiogram of the virtual patient, useful for the extraction of biomarkers.<br />  Multiscale models require to simulate from single cells to whole torso, which is very expensive computationally. Archer provides an infrastructure suitable for developing in silico drug trials, and allows to consider the personalization of treatment/prognosis according to different patients, due to the massive amounts of simulations needed for these purposes.<br />  The virtual patient shown suffers from ischaemia, a pathology related to a poor blood irrigation in some area of the heart. These patients are more likely to yield arrhythmias and on this case the virtual patient has developed ventricular fibrillation.
