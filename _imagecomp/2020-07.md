title: Endothelial glycocalyx -- defender of blood vessel walls
name: Xizhuo Jiang
institution: University College London, Department of Mechanical Engineering
description: The lumen side of our blood vessel walls is covered by a tree-like structure called endothelial glycocalyx (EG). This image shows the EG conformation under blood flow conditions. In this research, a dissipative particle dynamics method is used to investigate the blood flow profile over the complex surface configuration with EG. All the simulations and post-processing are implemented on ARCHER.	 <br /><br />				 The image is generated by VMD and trimmed in Adobe Illustrator.
