title: Enhanced mixing of neutral buoyant plume in dynamic environments of tidally induced internal waves bouncing between steep side walls of deep narrow rift valley
name: Dmitry Aleynik
institution: Physics Dept. Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS)
description:  Enhanced mixing of neutral buoyant plume in dynamic environments of tidally induced internal waves (IW) bouncing between steep side walls of deep narrow rift valley. (a) 3D snapshot of rising plume dispersal from Rainbow hydrothermal vent field at Mid Atlantic Ridge (36&deg;14'N), bathymetry is shown every 50 m. (b) Horizontal distribution of the non-hydrostatic pressure (dbar) at a water depth of 2200m assists to visualize IW upstream propagation as ripples, reflected from topography. (c) Vertical section of east/west baroclinic currents across the rift valley, tidal (vertically averaged) component was subtracted from full velocity profile (m/s). Overlapping white lines shows vertical displacement of isotherms (&deg;C), associated with IW; yellow isolines indicate spread of a passive tracer emanating from 'black smokers'. At ARCHER the MITgcm numerical simulation of the largest documented natural plume in deep Atlantic provide a proxy to assess environmental impacts of expected human activity (EC-FP7 MIDAS at SAMS).
