title: Dynamically fully self-consistent, 3-D numerical model of global mantle convection and single-sided subduction on Earth. Visible are cold, stiff surface plates (grey) sinking into the mantle and upwelling plumes of hot material (red) from the core-mantle boundary.

description:  The image shows a snapshot of our time-dependent, three-dimensional and fully spherical model of the Earth's mantle. It reproduces the thermal convection inside our planet's mantle that includes plate tectonics at the surface. It can self-consistently produce the nature-like single-sided sinking of the colliding plates (Crameri et al., 2012, GRL). The model is calculated on ARCHER with the finite-volume, multigrid code StagYY (Tackley 2008, PEPI), features a so-called 'sticky-air' layer to approximate a free surface, and is currently applied to study the interaction between mantle flow and surface topography at colliding plate boundaries (i.e., subduction zones), which are the regions of the largest earthquakes and the most active volcanoes on our planet. These modelling studies thereby allow us to understand the dynamic evolution of the Earth and why it happened so fundamentally different to all other rocky planets of our solar system.
