title: Numerical simulation of flooding following a dam breach
name: Dr Christian T. Jacobs
institution: Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London
description:  A visualisation of a numerical simulation of flooding following a dam breach. The setup considers a high-level of water that is initially held back by a dam wall (shaded grey). A 75 metre-wide breach in the wall is then considered, through which water rushes into the lower section to form a tidal bore wave. Swirling vortices are visible near the corners of the breach. The simulation was performed on Archer using a computational fluid dynamics code called Firedrake-Fluids to validate the numerical model. Such simulations can also be used to demonstrate how a catastrophic failure of a dam might affect surrounding inhabited areas.
