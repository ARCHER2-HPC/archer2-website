title: Spatial evolution and dissipation levels of a wingtip vortex in an incompressible turbulent flow 
name: Juan Carlos Bilbao-Ludena
institution: Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London
description:  Some of the enduring enigmas and mysteries of turbulence are encoded in the high-order statistical moments which can be accessed solely through Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or advanced experimental techniques. The image shows a DNS simulation of a wingtip vortex where the instantaneous velocity field is visualized with the use of the Q-criterion through contour planes showing dissipation magnitudes of the turbulent flow along the streamwise direction. Using Archer's capability of 375 cores, a 30 million cells simulation has been performed with our group's in-house code PANTARHEI. This configuration represents a flow with a high level of anisotropy where the prevalence of the wingtip's vortical structure can be observed in detail. The understanding of the vortex evolution in terms of high-order statistics in the near wake region is of great importance for the improvement of civil aviation safety standards now with the introduction of unmanned aircraft and higher saturated airspace.
