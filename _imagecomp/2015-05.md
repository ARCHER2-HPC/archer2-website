title: Flow visualisation through periodic boxes
name: Dr Matthieu Chavent
institution: University of Oxford, SBCB Group, Department of Biochemistry
description:  The cell membrane is a complex and crowded environment with different types of molecules such as lipids and proteins which are in a  dynamic equilibrium. To try to better understand this dynamic behaviour, it is possible to develop theoretical models mimicking this  membrane. Animating such models can be very challenging. Thus we used calculations launched on ARCHER computer to see how the constituents  of this membrane interact together. Inspired by approaches in physics to depict wind or ocean currents we developed a new way to display  collective movements of lipids molecules constituting the  <a href="http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/flows/">membrane model</a>.  This visualization allows  displaying flow-like movements of lipids. To simulate an infinite system, the unit cell in the center is repeated in all the directions. We  can see that the flows extend from one box to the other to create large vortices.
