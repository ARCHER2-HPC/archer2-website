title: Simulating the human ECG
name: Mr. Louie Cardone-Noott
institution: Computer Science, University of Oxford
description:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used for diagnosis. Simulations of the ECG are uniquely able to answer research questions in humans, because conventional experimentation is not possible and human simulations are more relevant (and ethical) than animal experiments. Solving such detailed mathematical models of the electrical activity in the human heart and torso is only possible with HPC resources like Archer.<br /> This image is a visualisation of the electrical potential in the ventricles and torso in a typical simulation of a normal heartbeat. Iso-surfaces (3-D contours) of electrical potential are shown emanating from the surface of the heart throughout the torso. By measuring the potentials at the body surface we can generate the 'simulated ECG', just like placing electrodes on the chest in the clinic.<br /> Simulations like these in Archer have many possible applications, including personalised medicine and drug discovery.
