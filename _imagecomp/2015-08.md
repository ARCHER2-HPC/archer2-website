title: Flow visualisation of vesicle model
name: Dr Matthieu Chavent
institution: University of Oxford, SBCB Group, Department of Biochemistry
description:  The cell membrane is a complex and crowded environment with different types of molecules such as lipids and proteins which are  in a dynamic equilibrium. To try to better understand this dynamic behaviour, it is possible to develop theoretical models mimicking  this membrane. Animating such models can be very challenging. Thus we used calculations launched on ARCHER computer to see how the  constituents of this membrane interact together. Inspired by approaches in physics to depict wind or ocean currents we developed a  new way to display collective movements of lipids molecules constituting the <a href="http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/flows/">membrane model</a>.   This visualization allows displaying flow-like movements of lipids in a vesicle model (made by Dr Tyler Reddy&colon; goo.gl/KO7lrU). Image  made with Paraview and rendered with Blender.
