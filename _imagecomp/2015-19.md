title: Visualising a magnetic recorder
name: Mr Lesleis Nagy
institution: University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences
description: Rocks contain naturally occurring magnets which record variations of the Earth's magnetic field. This image shows the result of  simulating the magnetic microstructure within a grain of pure magnetite. Fidelity and stability of magnetic recording depends upon  the fine variation of the direction of the magnetisation within the grain. In this image the magnetisation direction is highlighted  using streamlines formed from small arrows that align with the magnetisation. The redder the colour the more an arrow points along a  cube edge and the bluer, the more it points along a cube diagonal (inset). Streamlines of magnetisation can be seen to 'spill out' from  the central core and flow across the surface of the grain. The flat slice in the centre shows regions of uniform magnetisation called  domains. These domains are separated by walls, shown by the light blue spokes within the plane, emanating from the slice's centre.
