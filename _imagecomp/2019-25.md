title: Biomolecular simulation of antibiotic molecules diffusing and interacting with a bacterial cell envelope.
name: Dr. Conrado Pedebos
institution: School of Chemistry, University of Southampton
description: The video shows a biomolecular simulation which depicts the binding of several antibiotic molecules to a bacterial cell wall and to the large proteins contained in this cell region. The aim of this research project is to understand how the molecules attach and diffuse inside the bacterial cell, trying to bring new insights that could aid the development of better drugs. ARCHER's large computational power allowed us to perform biomolecular simulations of such a complex and huge molecular system.
