title: Study of interacting cracks in polycrystalline iron
name: Dr Anton Shterenlikht
institution: Mechanical Engineering Dept, University of Bristol
description:  The images show three alternative views of the same 10 cubic mm volume of iron with 10,000 uniquely shaped crystals.<br><br>To capture fine details of the shape of each crystal, they are built, on average, from 100,000 tiny cubic cells. The complete, 1 billion cell computer model, requires very large memory for the calculation and the visualisation, which is why we used Archer.<br><br>In the images the crystal boundaries are shown in purple. The cracks on {100} crystallographic planes are shown in yellow, and those on {110} planes are in green. {100} planes are easier to cleave, so there are more yellow cracks than green.<br><br>Cracks in individual crystals form a large crack system, spanning across multiple crystal boundaries. A view of cracks through semi-transparent network of crystal boundaries enables a detailed analysis of the influence of crystal boundary orientation on fracture energy, the ultimate aim of this work.
