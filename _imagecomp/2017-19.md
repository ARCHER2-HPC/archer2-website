title: Flamenco in the heart
name: Sha&iuml;ma Hashem
institution: Queen Mary University of London - School of Biological and Chemical Sciences
description:  It looks like a flamenco dancer but in reality, the image represents a superposition of structures 		of human cardiac myosin, a protein involved in heart contraction, highlighting its dominant collective 		motions. The motions with the largest amplitude involve important structural elements of myosin (converter, 		lever arm and N-terminal domain), which form the lower part of the red gown of the dancer. Flexible regions 		are also found in the upper part of myosin, where disordered loops involved in actin binding form the head 		and arms of the dancer. Analysis of these data shed light on the correlation between the different structural		elements of myosin and how it can be affected by drug binding. The figure was produced by running a principal 		component analysis on a myosin trajectory from a molecular dynamics simulation and visualising the structures 		along the dominant component using the VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) software.
