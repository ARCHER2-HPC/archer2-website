title: Movie showing pressure gradients and vortical structures around a transonic wing section. 
name: Markus Zauner
institution: AFM Group, University of Southampton
description:  This animation visualises vortex structures in the flow around an aircraft wing-section at a free-stream Mach number of Ma=0.7 and a Reynolds number of Re=500,000. Firstly, the movie highlights strong vorticity in blue and red, suggesting clockwise and anti-clockwise rotating vortices respectively. The black regions in the background indicate strong local pressure gradients. The formation of up-stream moving shock-waves over the upper surface can be observed near the trailing edge. The second part illustrates the 3D structure of the vortices, showing the so-called Q-criteria surfaces, based on a mathematical formulation to describe vortices. The data is obtaind by one of the largest direct numerical simulations to date. The grid consists of more than 1 billion cells and the time step is in the order of 10 nano seconds. The limitations due to memory and computational resources are challenging in respect to visualisation of 3D structures and their temporal behaviour.
