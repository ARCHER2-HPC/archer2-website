title: Oblique-mode breakdown "on sand"
name: Dr Andrea Sansica
institution: University of Southampton, Department of Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics
description:  High-fidelity direct numerical simulations represent the richest source of information in computational fluid dynamics. The computing effort needed to resolve all the significant spatial and temporal scales is however enormous and often prohibitive. The computational resources available in ARCHER allow numerical meshes of hundreds of millions of points and made possible to study fundamental flow configurations that only 10-15 years ago were simply unimaginable.<br /><br /> The interest is here focused on transition to turbulence and its effect on the structure of interaction between a shockwave and a supersonic boundary-layer. The figure describes the oblique-mode boundary-layer transition scenario that occurs at a Mach number of 1.5 downstream of the impingement shock-wave location.
