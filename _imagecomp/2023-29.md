title: High Pressure Jet Engine Turbine Blade Transitional Flow
description: The image shows an implicit Large Eddy simulation of the LS89 high-pressure turbine blade, a component typically found at the exit of a jet engine combustor. The flow field accelerates rapidly over a very short distance. For these particular conditions, flow transitions to 3D around the leading edge of the blade as shown by the wall shear stresses. Gradual increase in strength of the flow instability causes the flow to transition to turbulence with vortices appearing at the trailing edge. The back plane displays the time averaged variation of Mach number ranging from a value of approximately 0.15 at the inlet to nearly 1 in the latter stages of the blade. The solution uses a second order polynomial expansion and was simulated on Archer2 deploying 100 nodes at a time. This work has been carried out in collaboration with Rolls-Royce plc.
