title: Stratospheric ozone depletion &amp; recovery from 1960-2100
name: Dr. Nathan Luke Abraham
institution: National Centre for Atmospheric Science &amp; University of Cambridge, Department of Chemistry
description:  Following the discovery of the ozone hole in the 1980s, the Montreal Protocol was enacted 	to limit the release of harmful man-made pollutants that destroy stratospheric ozone. As part 		of of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI), past depletion and future recovery of ozone 		has been investigated using the United Kingdom Chemistry &amp; Aerosols (UKCA) Chemistry-Climate Model, a 		configuration of the Met Office Unified Model, with this particular simulation running from 1960 to 2100. The 		video shows the time evolution of the March and October total integrated atmospheric ozone column, highlighting 		the reduction in the recent past and subsequent increase over the coming century. The model data was processed 		using the Iris and Matplotlib Python libraries, ImageMagick, and FFmpeg. This simulation was 		performed on ARCHER, and data from the University of Cambridge UKCA simulations are available 		via the British Atmospheric Data Centre as part of the CCMI archive.
