title: Large Eddy Simulation of Cross-Ventilation of Buildings using uDALES 2.0 Codebase
name: Dr Dipanjan Majumdar
institution: Imperial College London, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department
description: uDALES is an open-source large-eddy simulation framework designed to simulate unsteady flows in the built environment. It encompasses airflow, sensible and latent heat transfer, and pollutant dispersion within the urban atmospheric boundary layer. The framework employs the immersed boundary method to resolve buildings and incorporates wall functions for surface shear stresses and heat fluxes. A three-dimensional surface energy balance model enables a two-way coupling for man-made and vegetative materials. To optimize performance, uDALES uses two-dimensional domain decomposition for parallelization on supercomputers like ARCHER2, allowing exascale computing. The presented video was generated while testing viability of the latest version uDALES 2.0 in handling indoor-outdoor flow interactions. In this regard, we simulated the cross-ventilation in a generic isolated enclosure, based on the work of Hooff et al. (2017). The video reveals the instantaneous stream-wise velocity as the flow exits through the downstream window.
