title: Thermal plumes in thermally driven turbulence
name: Xiaojue Zhu
institution: Physics of Fluids Group, University of Twente
description: This image shows the structures of three-dimensional turbulent thermal plumes in a box heated from below and cooled from the top, which is a simple model for the natural convection systems, such as those present in geo- and astro-physics. Turbulent thermal plumes are generated on the plates, forming the large scale rolls, mimicking the wind in Nature. This direct numerical simulation was performed on ARCHER with 1 billion grid points in a highly turbulent flow system.
