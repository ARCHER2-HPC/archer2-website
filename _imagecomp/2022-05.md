title: Ray-traced Cloud Development Simulation Image
name: Domantas Dilys
institution: University of Leeds, School of Earth and Enviroment
description: In the image, an idealised cloud is shown, which is produced by a rising warm and moist air mass. Simulation was produced using a revolutionary parcel-based cloud model developed by the University of St Andrews, the University of Leeds and EPCC. The model, PMPIC, was parallelised in an eCSE project (eCSE12-10), and run on ARCHER2. During 2022 Summer Visualisation Internship, the image was produced on the GPU-enabled Faculty of Engineering Linux system at the University of Leeds. Volume rendering capabilities of ParaView, in particular, IntelÂ® OSPRay path-tracer was used for realistic lighting and self-shadowing. The shadows appear for any region of the cloud, as rays shoot in the direction of the light source, determining if that region is obstructed from light source or not. The image has slightly increased contrast by post-processing.
