title: Harnessing the power of the Sun&colon; Magnetic reconnection in a cross-section of a realistic tokamak simulated with the JOREK code
name: Dr Jane Pratt, M. Hoelzl and E. Westerhof
institution: Astrophysics Group, University of Exeter
description:  Fusion is a process that heats the Sun and stars.  If harnessed in the future, fusion could generate large amounts of carbon-free energy.  A tokamak, a machine that uses a magnetic field to confine the hot ionized gas that makes up a plasma, has the potential to produce energy using fusion. In a tokamak, plasma resistivity causes magnetic field lines to reconnect, forming magnetic islands. When a magnetic island grows to a large size, it can result in fast escape of plasma from the machine.<br />    This image shows a cross-section of a realistic tokamak configuration with a divertor, obtained as a snapshot from a simulation with JOREK, a nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics  code. A large magnetic island is created by a perturbation of the current density which is indicated by the colours&colon; negative current perturbations are displayed by blue colours, positive current perturbations are displayed by red colours. White lines have been plotted over the current perturbation to visualize the surfaces of constant magnetic flux. Outside of the magnetic island, these surfaces are nearly concentric. The size and position of the magnetic island is indicated by the surfaces of constant magnetic flux that form isolated pockets between the concentric circles.
