title: Supersonic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability simulation
name: Panagiotis Tsoutsanis
institution: Cranfield University, SATM
description:  This is an animation of the simulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability obtained with the CFD code UCNS3D on Archer. The animation shows the evolution of small shear layer instabilities into chaotic vortical structures, that interact with pressure waves.<br />		Research for this type of problems are widely used by the scientific community as a tool to assess the suitability of various numerical methods and techniques for turbulent flows. This is of paramount importance firstly for improving our understanding of turbulence itself, and secondly to be able to more accurately and efficiently predict the behaviour of engineering and scientific designs under turbulent flow conditions.
