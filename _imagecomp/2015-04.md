title: Polymeric nanocomposite materials.
name: Dr Hugh Martin
institution: University College London, Department of Chemistry
description:  We combine large-scale and small-scale computer models to show how polymers intermix with very large, but very thin, clay sheets to  form polymeric nanocomposite materials. They use quantum mechanics, a very expensive technique, to accurately determine the force field  around the edge of the clay. To make the simulation of full sheets possible (and affordable), they use more approximate models (atom-based  and so-called "coarse-grained" molecular dynamics). The polymers are shown in orange, and the sheets in cyan. They are the first to show how  polymer molecules enter between the clay sheets to create a hybrid structure with unique material properties, using a computer model where  the clay sheets, their edges and their flexible surfaces, are fully taken into account. They aim to systematically model a range of these  materials, thereby helping experimental specialists to identify candidate materials for (more expensive and time-consuming) experimental testing.
