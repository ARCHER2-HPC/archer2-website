title: Soot precursor benzene (C6H6) from a commercial jet fuel spray flame shown in a cross-section of a lab-scale burner
name: Jenna Foale
institution: University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering
description:  Liquid fuels -- gasoline, diesel, and kerosene -- power most transportation. As the world begins to transition to lower-carbon fuel sources, we must do our best to reduce emissions from the fossil fuels which power our vehicles in the meantime. With Archer's computational power we can solve fluid mechanics and combustion chemistry equations to predict benzene (C6H6) production, a major species producing soot in flames used to power aircraft (benzene is shown in the gaseous field cross-section of a burner). Using detailed chemistry for liquid kerosene spray (shown as white droplets), we can adapt combustion models to predict soot and emission production from both conventional and alternative jet fuels at both stable and extreme in-flight operating conditions. These efforts will reduce emissions from aviation until fossil fuels are no longer needed for commercial flight.
