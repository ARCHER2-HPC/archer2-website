title: Stimulating competition between electrons with two colour light fields
name: Dr Andrew Brown
institution: CTAMOP, Queen's University Belfast
description:  The image shows the light emitted by a neon atom subjected to two laser pulses; an ultrashort, high  energy pulse, and a few-cycle long wavelength pulse. By varying the time delay between the pulses we can  selectively suppress the high-harmonic radiation emission of one electron (the 'valley' like feature)  allowing us to observe the contribution of the second electron, which extends the yield to higher energy.  The calculations are performed with the RMT code, which has been developed specifically to model  the correlated dynamics of many-electron systems.
