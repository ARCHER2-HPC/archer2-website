title: Simulation of a Heartbeat in the Cardiovascular System Through Multi-Component Coupling
description: This video showcases a successful simulation of a heartbeat and blood flow in the vasculature, achieved by coupling the 3D electromechanical heart model in Alya with the 3D vascular flow model in HemeLB. These models are developed by separate research groups (BSC and UCL), focus on different dynamical scales (macroscopic and mesoscopic), and employ distinct discretisation methods (finite element and lattice Boltzmann). The simulation was executed on ARCHER2 using 4096 cores across 32 nodes. This successful collaboration highlights the potential of multi-component coupling and represents a significant milestone towards creating a virtual human.
