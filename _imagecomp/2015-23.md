title: Momentum of electrons after ionisation of a Helium atom
name: Mr Jack Wragg
institution: Queen's University Belfast
description:  We're interested in electron behavior over short timescales. This knowledge allows us to work towards controlling chemical reactions,  making better lasers, and creating an 'attosecond video camera' that can see chemical reactions as they happen. We obtain results from  computer codes developed to model electrons in atoms.<br /><br /> The picture shows what happens when a helium atom absorbs enough energy from a laser pulse that two electrons leave the atom.  It  shows the probability of each electron having momentum k_{1} and k_{2} as it moves away from the atom. Features of the way the  electrons absorb and then share energy from the laser pulse can be seen&colon; the curved lines show when the energy is shared between  the electrons, and the straight lines show when this sharing doesn't happen. Modeling Two-Electron ionisation is a large task that  wouldn't be possible without the extended capabilities that ARCHER provides.
