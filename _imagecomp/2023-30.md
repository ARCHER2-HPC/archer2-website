title: High Pressure Jet Engine Turbine Blade in Shocked Flow
description: The video shows the Mach number of an implicit Large Eddy simulation of the LS89 high-pressure turbine blade, a component typically found at the exit of a jet engine combustor. The very high level of suction at the outflow causes a very strong acceleration causing a shock to appear (the flow accelerates from ~60m/s to 280m/s in ~10cm). This interacts with the adjacent blade's wake and the waves emanating off the blade trailing edge are clearly visible. The most complicated aspect in setting up this case is represented by the unsteady boundary layer/shock interaction and the high energy vortices. This particular simulation is 4th order accurate and was run with Nektar++ on Archer2 using a high-order quadrilateral mesh. This work has been carried out in collaboration with Rolls-Royce plc.
