title: Iso-Surfaces of Lambda2 showing wake formation from stator blades of a DLR research compressor
name: Dr Arun Prabhakar
institution: University of Warwick, Department of Computer Science
description: The visualization is acquired from a simulation of a research compressor, RIG250 from the German Aerospace Centre(DLR), using a mesh consisting of 654 Million elements. It depicts the unsteady vortex shedding behavior from a row of stator blades. Rolls-Royce's in house production CFD solver, Hydra, is used to solve the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The flow in the domain is highly turbulent and is predicted using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with wall functions. The visualization shows iso-surfaces of wakes computed using a parameter called Lambda2. The resulting iso-surfaces are colored with the axial velocity of the flow. In situ visualization is carried out using Rolls-Royce's SS02 code, based on ParaView. This large scale simulation denotes a step towards virtual certification of gas turbine engines.
