description:  A confocal micrograph of antigen-presenting cells packed with millions of amorphous magnesium-substituted calcium  phosphate (AMCP) nanoparticles loaded with bacterial peptidoglycan. Superimposed is the ARCHER-resolved inorganic-organic  nanoparticles, modelled with first-principles code CASTEP. In the background image, taken by Jack Robertson, the cell  nuclei are shown in blue, AMCP in green and peptidoglycan in red. The modelled particles show oxygen in red, carbon  in grey, hydrogen in white, nitrogen in blue, calcium in green, phosphorus in purple and magnesium in yellow.<br />  AMCP nanoparticles have been observed in the human gut in vast quantities. These tiny particles act as Trojan horses,  crossing the gut epithelium and delivering trapped protein fragments from food and bacteria, to the cells of the immune  system. Here the protein cargo is unpacked in the cell lysosome and an immuno-tolerant signal is induced, ensuring we  do not experience an inflammatory response to food that we eat; in certain conditions, such as Crohn's Disease, this  signal is not produced. In this image we show how ARCHER was used to explore the atomistic structure and chemistry of  these composite nanoparticles, something that is not currently possible with experimental techniques. The background  image is a 3D section of human antigen-presenting cells loaded with AMCP nanoparticles. The co-localization of the  red (peptidoglycan) and green (AMCP) shows how the particles trap the protein in their structure to ferry it across the gut wall.
