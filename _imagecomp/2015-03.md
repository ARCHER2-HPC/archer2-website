title: Electron charge cloud around Buckyball.
name: Dr Sam Azadi
institution: Imperial College London
description: Fullerene&colon; the 60-carbon-atom cluster C60 called Fullerene (Buckyball to the general public) and its 70-atom cousin C70 are the most  talked-about discovery in materials since high-temperature superconductors. Experimentalists have shown that solids based on buckyballs  can be insulators, conductors, semiconductors or even superconductors when doped with other atoms or molecules. Pure buckyball solids  form crystal structures, like graphite or diamond that are insulators or semiconductors. However when doped with an alkali metal, such  as potassium or rubidium, these solids can become electricity-conducting metals. This photo shows the electron cloud around Buckyball,  which plays crucial role in study of metal-insulator transition in these materials.
