title: Iso-surfaces of Q-criterion coloured with the streamwise velocity for a non-thermal plasma counter-flow actuator with serpentine-shaped electrodes.
name: Dr Andrea Sansica
institution: University of Southampton, Department of Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics
description:  High-fidelity direct numerical simulations represent the richest source of information in computational fluid dynamics. The computing effort needed to resolve all the significant spatial and temporal scales is however enormous and often prohibitive. The computational resources available in ARCHER allow numerical meshes of hundreds of millions of points and made possible to study fundamental flow configurations that only 10-15 years ago were simply unimaginable.<br /> <br />  A non-thermal plasma actuator is used to trigger transition to turbulence in a supersonic boundary-layer. The introduction of serpentine-shaped electrodes destabilises the boundary-layer more efficiently and transition occurs earlier. Compared to classical straight-edged electrodes, the serpentine-electrodes demonstrate improved capabilities on the reduction of energy consumption.
