title: Contour plots of density from the evolution of a triple material interaction, simulated with a hybrid DG-FV method using UCNS3D
description: The evolution of the collision of three distinct materials, give rise to spectacular visuals ranging from interaction of shockwaves to vortical instabilities across the interfaces, to chaotic mixing that disperses materials. These collisions can be found in several settings such as supernova explosions, inertial confinement fusion, and ablation of thermal protection systems. Gaining a deeper understanding of these worlds depends on developing numerical frameworks that are highly efficient, accurate, and robust. In this instance this triple material interaction has been simulated on ARCHER2, by a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin- Finite Volume found in the open-source UCNS3D CFD software.
