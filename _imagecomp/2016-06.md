title: Substructures in a Milky Way-like dark matter halo
name: Mr Raphael Errani
institution: Institute for Astronomy, Royal Observatory, University of Edinburgh
description:  Galaxies like our own, the Milky Way, are presumed to form within haloes of Dark Matter, which exceed in mass the amount  of stars and gas easily by a factor ten. Understanding the properties of Dark Matter haloes helps us to get an insight  in the physics of Dark Matter, and might contribute to reveal its true nature. This simulation snapshot shows the distribution  of Dark Matter in a halo similar to the one of the Milky Way, where the simulation adapts a novel approach to reveal intricate  details such as shells and streams of disrupted dwarf galaxies at unprecedented resolution. Such substructures are remnants of  the process of hierarchical galaxy formation and have been found to exist also in our own Galaxy, and their structure and  distribution is highly sensitive to the physical properties of Dark Matter.
