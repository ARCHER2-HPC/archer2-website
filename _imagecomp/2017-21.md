title: Simulated supercell storm
name: Bethan White
institution: Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, University of Oxford
description:  This video shows a very high resolution simulation of a supercell thunderstorm. Supercells are high-impact severe storm systems and frequently produce tornadoes, hail, and very heavy rain. The transparent white - blue shaded surfaces show cloud water, cloud ice, and rain and snow which precipitate out of the cloud. The green-blue contour on the bottom shows the rain accumulated at the surface from the storm. This type of storm splits into two during its development and new clouds form from the mature clouds. The very high resolution of this simulation allows these processes to be seen. This simulation was performed as part of a study investigating the impact of model resolution on how well simulations produce supercell storms and rainfall, and thereby aims to help improve the forecasting of such severe weather events.
