title: Multiphysics simulation and machine learning predict how dinosaurs move
name: Dr. William Sellers
institution: School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester
description:  The laws of physics apply for extinct animals exactly as they do for living ones. We used robotic simulation combined with mechanical load analysis and our knowledge of comparative anatomy to build virtual dinosaurs. Using Archer we were able to use massively parallel evolutionary algotithms to explore how these animals could have moved and used this information to predict how fast Tyrannosaurus rex could run based on the maximum loads the skeleton could cope with. The image was produced using an entirely open source toolchain. The output from GaitSym, our in house simulation package, was imported directly into Blender, suitable lights were added, and the final image was rendered using Cycles.  The colour patterns midway through the leg bones represent the load experienced by the skeleton at that point in time.
