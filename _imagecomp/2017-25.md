title: Graphene Surfing
name: Robert Sinclair
institution: Department of Chemistry, University College London
description:  A graphene flake (blue) surfing on an undulating graphene sheet. Travelling waves in a  suspended graphene sheet have been observed experimentally, this video shows how a graphene flake  on top of such a surface could catch these waves and surf in the trough for large distances, almost  frictionlessly. Peaks in the surface are coloured white, troughs are black. This process is a means  of separating flakes by size, as the flake must be close to half the wavelength in diameter for this  process to occur. ARCHER was used to develop a new force-field for simulating graphene structures  on an atomic scale. This allowed an accurate description of the friction between graphene sheets, with  the aim of better understanding the notoriously difficult process of exfoliating graphene and studying  its superlubric nature.
