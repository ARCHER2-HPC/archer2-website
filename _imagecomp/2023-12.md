title: Fully general evolution of a field outside of a rotating black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime
name: Dr Lorenzo Rossi
institution: Queen Mary University of London, School of Mathematical Sciences
description: The image shows four snapshots of the gravitational evolution of a field outside of a rotating black hole immersed in a spacetime called anti-de Sitter (AdS). It is obtained from the first and only code able to simulate gravity in AdS in full generality, i.e., with dynamics along all 3 spatial dimensions. The simulation is performed on Archer2 on a 3-dimensional Cartesian grid and the snapshots display the x=0 slice. The boundary of AdS is a sphere, whose x=0 slice is the edge of the disk displayed in the snapshots.<br> AdS is crucial for the celebrated AdS/CFT duality, a precise correspondence between gravity in AdS (such as the one displayed in the image) and the physics of a conformal field theory (CFT) at the AdS boundary. In turn, CFTs provide insights on theories of quantum particles (there are no other tools to study such theories in the strong coupling regime).
