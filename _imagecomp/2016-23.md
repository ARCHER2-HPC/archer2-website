title: Three dimensional, unsteady, flows around an aircraft wing in various flight conditions
name: Dr. Marco Rosti, Dr Mohammad Omidyeganeh and Prof. Alfredo Pinelli
institution: Dept. of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, City University of London
description:  We have studied the three dimensional, unsteady, flows around a wing in various flight conditions, mimicking those experienced during take-off and landing or the influence of a wind gust. With the aid of numerical simulations, as an alternative to experiments in a wind tunnel, we were able to develop new wing designs that can enhance aerodynamic performance at no extra cost. These can improve an aircraft's manoeuvrability, increase the amount of weight it can carry, or reduce the fuel consumed - all of which may contribute to reductions in greenhouse gases. The picture shows the isosurfaces of the Q-criterion (top) and the Lagrangian Coherent structures (bottom) of an aerofoil at 20&deg; of incidence at Re=20000.
