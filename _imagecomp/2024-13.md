title: 3D streamlines around porous disks at varying incidence angles
description: We numerically investigate the flow around three-dimensional (3D) porous disks at various incidence angles. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted on ARCHER2 (project&colon; e812) to study how inclination affects the aerodynamics of porous disks. The image presents 3D streamlines of the flow around high-permeability porous disks at different incidence angles, coloured by streamwise velocity.
