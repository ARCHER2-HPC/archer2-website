title: Turbulent breakdown at the rear section of a wing section at transonic flow conditions.
name: Markus Zauner
institution: AFM Group, University of Southampton
description:  This picture shows the rear section of an airfoil at a Mach and Reynolds number of Ma=0.7 and Re=500,000 respectively. The presented flow field is resolved by more than 5 billion cells and is generated by a direct numerical simulation running with more than 60,000 cores on ARCHER. Q-criteria surfaces are used to indicate vortex structures, which are coloured by the vorticity magnitude. Regions comprising strong vortices appear yellow in the plot, whereas weaker vortical structures show up light blue. The snapshot is taken after restarting from a solution with a 80% narrowerer spanwise periodic domain. This picture indicates a reasonably fast breakdown of the former periodicity.
