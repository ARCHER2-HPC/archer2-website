description:  We present a fully automatic pipeline from the clinical magnetic resonance images to the simulation of the electrocardiogram. These personalised 3D finite element models of the geometry of the torso and heart together with a detailed electrophysiological model at cellular level allow us to virtually simulate the electrical activity of the heart. This electrical activity is propagated through the internal tissues with different impedances up to the torso surface. The high complexity of these models as well as the different scales involved make the whole pipeline a challenge in terms of computational resources. The use of Archer and its parallelisation facilities allows us to simulate one heart beat in 2 hours in 960 processors on a ~50 million element mesh.
