title: Comparison of vortex evolution over pitching forward and backward swept wings
description: This image shows how the vortex-dominated flow evolves around periodically pitching forward and backward swept wings in the laminar regime. The evolution has been layered in time, with earlier stages faded to suggest motion from past to present. The sliding meshing technique, combined with the arbitrary mesh interface boundary condition, allows the pitching motion of an inner rotating domain. The simulations were performed using a finite volume method-based Navier-Stokes solver with the framework of open-source code OpenFOAM on the ARCHER2 HPC system. The domain decomposition technique, such as scotch, enables the numerical simulation of these wings to be performed with large numbers of CPUs, thereby speeding up the extensive solution time. The unsteady wake patterns in the airflow resulting from the kinematic motion of the wing are challenging to examine experimentally. Therefore, access to these resources elucidates the unsteady aerodynamic phenomena and their implications for future wing design in low-speed aerial vehicles.
