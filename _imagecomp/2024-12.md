title: Molecular dynamics computation of Glycerol monooleate (GMO) molecules gathering around water droplets to form reverse-micelles helping lubrication efficiency.
description: Lubrication is a complex but important problem; its study can help reduce wear between solid surfaces. Glycerol monooleate (GMO) is known to have impressive lubricating properties. The addition of a small amount of GMO to a lubricant can drastically lower its friction. The GMO molecules gather around small droplets of water forming "reverse-micelles". Under shear, these reverse-micelles get caught on the roughest areas of the solid surface and reduce the resultant friction. The image, from a LAMMPS computation, shows the water molecules in blue, GMO molecules as their atomistic components (black, red and purple) while the solvent is hidden for clarity. The visualisation was done using Blender, allowing for fine control over camera placement and lighting, which helps highlight important features of the computation while producing a visually pleasing image suitable for non-scientific audiences.<br>The dataset and domain knowledge were provided by Rui Apóstolo (10.1039/d3nr05080g).
