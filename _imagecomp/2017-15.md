title: Flame-Acoustics-turbulence interation in a "noisy" gas turbine model combustor
name: Zhi Chen
institution: University of Cambridge, Engineering Department
description:  This video shows the three-way physical interaction between flame, acoustics and turbulence inside a gas turbine model combustor simulated using ARCHER. Air flow is fed into the combustor from the top-left inlet and passes through two swirlers where it is mixed with injected natural gas fuel. The mixture then enters the combustion chamber and ignites immediately forming a swirl flame as projected on the horizontal plane using heat release contours. Due to strong turbulence as indicated by the wrinkled flame surface, the unsteady heat release emits acoustic waves which interact with the combustor internal geometry establishing a thermos-acoustic instability. This can be seen on the vertical plane where the acoustic waves bounce back and forth producing a "screaming" sound. Understanding this problem helps to develop "quieter and greener" combustors for future gas turbines. <br />		The image frames were created using Paraview and made into a movie using Mac iMovie.
