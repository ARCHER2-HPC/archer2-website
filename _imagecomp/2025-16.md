title: Vortical structures in a swirling jet, visualised using a Q-criterion isosurface coloured by vorticity magnitude.
description: Gas turbines are widely used for aircraft propulsion and power generation, and improving their efficiency while reducing emissions is a key step toward cleaner energy. Hydrogen is a promising alternative fuel because it produces no carbon dioxide when burned. However, hydrogen flames are highly sensitive to turbulence and can become unstable, making them difficult to control. Gaining a clear understanding of how swirling flow patterns influence flame behaviour is therefore essential for the safe and reliable operation of future gas turbines.<br><br>The image is a Q-criterion isosurface coloured by vorticity magnitude from a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a swirling flow, carried out using the fully compressible solver SENGA2 on ARCHER2. It reveals the vortical structures that form when air is injected into a chamber at a given swirl number. These flow patterns are representative of conditions inside a gas turbine combustor.<br><br>By studying the flow field in detail before combustion, we can identify mechanisms that may later trigger instabilities once the flame is ignited. This knowledge underpins efforts to predict and control flame behaviour in practical combustors.
