title: Formation of a Reverse K치rm치n Vortex Street in the Wake of a Morphing Wing
description: A fully flexible aerofoil, with varying flexibilities at the leading and trailing edges, mitigates the effect of gust through passive morphing. The flexible morphing foil interacts with incoming fluid flow, creating a symmetrical reverse K치rm치n vortex street in its wake through the alternate shedding of opposite sense vortices resulting from the leading- and trailing-edge vortex interactions. Capturing this required high-fidelity simulations on the Archer2 HPC system by coupling OpenFOAM (finite-volume method) as the fluid solver with CalculiX (finite-element method) as the solid solver. This wake pattern, formed by a coherent train of vortices with opposite sense of rotation at high Strouhal number is representative of thrust generation. Visualised using finite-time Lyapunov exponent, this image showcases the benefits of dynamic fluid-structure interaction.
