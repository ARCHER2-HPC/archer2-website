title: Pesticide Spray in Drone Downwash
description: The video shows a simulation of an agricultural drone dispersing pesticides. Agricultural drones have become invaluable in modern farming for tasks such as monitoring crop health, planting seeds, and spraying fertilisers and pesticides.  Drones are especially advantageous for farming uneven terrain that is otherwise difficult for ground-based machinery to navigate. The turbulent air flow from the rotors disperses the fluid more evenly across the land. Understanding and optimising the complex interaction between rotor downwash and pesticide dispersion has the potential to bring significant efficiency improvements to farming, and in doing so contributes towards meeting the global challenge of food security.
