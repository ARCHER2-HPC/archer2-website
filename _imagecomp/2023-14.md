title: Fully general evolution of the CFT energy density dual to gravity outside of a rotating black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime
name: Dr Lorenzo Rossi
institution: Queen Mary University of London, School of Mathematical Sciences
description: According to the celebrated AdS/CFT, gravity in the so-called anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime is dual to the physics of a conformal field theory (CFT) at the AdS boundary. In turn, CFTs provide insights on theories of quantum particles (there are no other tools to study such theories in the strong coupling regime). The boundary of AdS is the sphere displayed in the video.<br> The video shows the evolution of the CFT energy density dual to the gravitational evolution of a field outside of a rotating black hole immersed in AdS. It is obtained from the first and only code able to simulate gravity in AdS in full generality, i.e., with dynamics along all 3 spatial dimensions. The simulation is performed on Archer2 on a 3-dimensional Cartesian grid. Subsequently, the values of the corresponding function on this grid are used to extrapolate the displayed values on the sphere.
