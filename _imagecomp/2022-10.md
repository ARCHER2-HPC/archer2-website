title: Scattering in real space, diffusion in wavenumber space
name: Dr Hossein Kafiabad
institution: School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh
description: When the waves travel in the atmosphere and ocean interior, they get scattered by the vortices leading to changes in their direction and wavelength. If the background vortices are isotropic (do not have a preferred direction) and evolve on much slower time scale than that of waves, we have shown that the wave energy in wavenumber space diffuses on a cone, which is pictured in this figure. In the top panel the vertical velocity of waves for horizontal slice of a 3D flow is shown where the time increase from left to right, and in the bottom the corresponding wave energy in wavenumber space is shown. The wave field is extracted from a Boussinesq simulation. The initial condition of this simulation is a plane wave (the top left panel) superimposed on a fully-developed turbulent flow.
