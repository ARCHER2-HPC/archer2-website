title: The diffusitivity of protein, lipid and solvent molecules from a simulation with periodicity removed.
name: Mr Robin Corey
institution: University of Bristol
description:  Detailed information on the motion of molecules can be gathered using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Using  a "coarse-grained" force field, we have modelled a protein-lipid membrane system to map interaction sites between  our target protein and a specific membrane lipid, furthering our understanding of this fundamental protein system.<br /> MD simulations are generally built using boxes with periodic boundaries, meaning there are infinite boxes in all  directions. Usually, the data is processed so that molecules leaving the box on one side re-enter on the other. I have  removed this to chart the total movement of each molecule over ~10 microseconds. In the image, the diffusivity of white  water molecules, red and blue ions, purple lipids and orange protein are shown in relation to the original MD box (yellow).  The restricted diffusion of the solvent, caused by the lipid membrane, creates a galaxy-like effect.
