description:  Steered Molecular Dynamic Simulations of a natural haemoglobin derived di-peptide migrating to the active site of the Malarial plasmodium falciparum M1 alanyl aminopeptidase (PFM1AAP). (Bottom Right) Substrate recognition mechanism coordinating the di-peptide Arginine-Alanine to the entrance of the C-Terminal binding cavity. Red highlights negatively charged residues, Blue represents residues with a positively charged side chain. (Top Right) The Critical Arginine residue located within the C-Terminal channel actively pulling substrates from the entrance of the cavity, deep into the channel. Three states are visualised along the simulation also with the position of the substrate during the initial and final contact with the Arginine residue. (Left) Cartoon representation of PFM1AAP coloured by domain&colon; I (blue), II (green), III (yellow) and IV (red). The long C-Terminal binding cavity is visualised as a surface representation in cyan.<br />With the advent of ever increasing computational power it is now within our grasps to simulate the binding pathways of substrates and inhibitors using High Performance Computing Clusters and Molecular Dyanmic simulations. Here, we simulate various substrates and inhibitors migrating through the binding pathway of a protein, plasmodium falciparum M1 alanayl aminopeptidase (PFM1AAP), that supports the malarial parastitc survival. Our simulations reveal critical areas of the protein which facilitate the binding process of the haemoglobin dervide peptides. The results of which pave the way for the design of new, novel theraputics against the malarial epidemic. The image provided shows an atomistic view of coordination and active migration mechanism that may be specifically targeted to inhibit the enzyme and ultimately starve the malarial parasite from its food source. All images were rendered in pymol.
