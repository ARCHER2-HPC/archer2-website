title: Order of Turbulence generates sound
name: Dr Zhong-Nan Wang
institution: University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering
description:  The picture shows the noise generated from a turbulent jet interacting with a flat plate. This is a simplfied model of an aero-engine installed under a wing. Coherent structures, shown in Q-criterion, roll up at the edge of jet plume, indicating an underlying order of turbulence. Acoustic waves, indicated by the background gray-scale contours, are produced by the flow structures and their interactions with the plate trailing edge.
