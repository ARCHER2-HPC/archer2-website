title: Schematic representation of an atom-by-atom  building process of  nanostructures using purely   mechanical forces of an atomic force microscope (AFM)  and atomically sharp  tips.
name: David Abbasi Perez
institution: King's College London, Department of Physics
description:  This little cartoon represents a complicated mechanism in which a crane-like device is capable of pick up and deposit one adsorbed atom at a time on the surface and repeat this process many times in order to build 3D nanostructures. This full picking-deposition cycle is key in order to build 3D nanostructures on an atom-by-atom basis using purely mechanical forces of an atomic force microscopy (AFM). This is known as mechanochemistry. The atomic crane is an atomic force microscopy oscillating tip and the material is GaAs.  Although extremely difficult from an experimental point of view, simulations run on Archer show that this process is in principle possible. The animation has been created frame-by-frame using the open source code Krita.
