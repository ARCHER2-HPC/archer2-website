title: Simulating coastal current separation
name: Max Holloway
institution: Scottish Association for Marine Science, Physics
description:  A high-resolution ocean model simulation capturing current separation along the north-east coastline of 				 the island of Rum, on the Scottish west coast. Panels A-F show simulated hourly sea surface temperature (SST) and 				 current velocities during July 2019. The high-resolution simulation is nested within larger regional models (panel G) using 				 the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). This was undertaken as part of the OffAqua project, which is evaluating 				 the environmental conditions required for the development of offshore aquaculture.
