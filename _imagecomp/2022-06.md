title: Cloud Development - Cross-section View
name: Domantas Dilys
institution: University of Leeds, School of Earth and Enviroment
description: In the animation, an idealised cloud is shown, which is produced by a rising warm and moist air mass. There are seven timesteps, showing cloud development over time. Simulation was produced using a revolutionary parcel-based cloud model developed by the University of St Andrews, the University of Leeds and EPCC. The model, PMPIC, was parallelised in an eCSE project (eCSE12-10), and run on ARCHER2. During 2022 Summer Visualisation Internship, the video was produced on the GPU-enabled Faculty of Engineering Linux system at the University of Leeds. Volume Rendering capabilities of ParaView, as well as custom cross-section filter made it possible to obtain a unique perspective of the inside of the cloud, as it is developing. The colours show the liquid water content, from blue to red signifying low-to-high liquid content.
