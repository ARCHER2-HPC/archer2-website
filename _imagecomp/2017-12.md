title: West Scotland Coastal Ocean Modelling System (WeStCOMS) - 3D currents animation
name: Dmitry Aleynik and Sam Jones
institution: Scottish Association for Marine Science, Physics Department
description:  Circulation pattern generated by the West Scotland Coastal Ocean Modelling System (WeStCOMS) run at ARCHER. WeStCOMS comprise an operational coupled ocean and atmospheric high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic models based on the unstructured-mesh Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM, 0.1&divide;3km) and the Weather Research Forecasts (WRF, 2x2km) respectively. Model results have been intensively validated against observations including current meters, conductivity/temperature/pressure sensors on stationary moorings, drifters, gliders. The visualization was created in cooperation with S. Jones over weekly hindcast runs. Operational model five-days forecasts enable stakeholders and community with the informed decision-making tool both in a field of academic research (stratified fluid tidal mixing, connectivity, sea-lice, pathogens, invasive species dispersal, Environmental Impact Assessment studies) and as an early warning  predictive scheme for quick response mitigation measures during industrial and natural hazards, e.g. harmful algae bloom, oil spills, and in a support of sustainable development in Aquaculture, Renewable and other Blue Growth economy sectors.
