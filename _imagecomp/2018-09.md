title: Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, but which cobalt nanoparticles exactly are the best for biomedical applications?
name: Barbara Farkas
institution: School of Chemistry, Cardiff University
description:  Magnetic nanoparticles continue to improve the efficiency of numerous biomedical techniques as visualization agents in MRI, therapeutic vehicles in drug delivery and heat mediators in hyperthermia. However, with the long-lasting clinical testing and so many different options on the table, there is a big chance of missing some of the promising materials. Recent advances in theoretical modelling and available supercomputing power have greatly contributed to the design of magnetic nanoparticles with multifunctional capabilities, which enhanced their applications in the biomedicine.<br><br>This image represents a challenge of finding the best match of the nanoparticle's type, shape, and size with combinations reaching a large number - in the order of hundreds - only for single-element metallic materials. ARCHER made it possible to test cobalt nanoparticles as potentially promising candidates for hyperthermia treatments progressing from small non-crystalline clusters to a series of different crystalline motifs of up to 1500 atoms per nanoparticle.
