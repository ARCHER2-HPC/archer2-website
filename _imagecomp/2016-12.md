title:  Graphene's Dirac fermions screen a charged impurity.
name: Dr Fabiano Corsetti
institution: Department of Materials, Imperial College London
description:  Two-dimensional materials hold the potential to unlock revolutionary advances in technology  with the development of ultrasmall devices for nano and bioelectronics, biosensors, flexible  electronics, photovoltaics, and more. The realisation of 2D devices relies crucially on understanding  and controlling the interaction with adsorbates. We use ARCHER to simulate this interaction using a  multiscale methodology which bridges first-principles density-functional theory calculations with  large-scale tight-binding Hamiltonians. The image shows a simulation of an isolated calcium adatom on  graphene; the calcium is charged, and therefore acts as a Coulomb impurity that is screened by the electrons  in graphene (shown by the green cutaway surface). The screening properties of graphene are unique due the  properties of its massless Dirac quasiparticles.
