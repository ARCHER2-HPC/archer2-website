title: Flow Around a Peregrine Falcon and Barn Own during Gust Encounters
description: This video presents the response of flexible bio-inspired peregrine falcon and owl wings to a sudden rotational gust in terms of accelerated pitching. As the wings are subjected to gust, vortex shedding intensifies, with the owl wing shedding the most coherent leading-edge vortex and generally generating larger vortical structures than the falcon wing. Line integral convolution, allowing us to visualise streamlines, highlights these differences in the resulting fluid flow between the two wings. The differences highlight how wing morphology and variable flexibility influence the resulting vortices, providing insight into the fluid-structure interaction of different bird wings during flight. Simulations were performed on the Archer2 HPC system, using a coupled fluid-structure interaction approach coupling OpenFOAM (finite-volume method) for the fluid solver with CalculiX (finite-element method) for the solid solver.
