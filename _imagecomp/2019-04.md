title: Store Glacier calving in response to melt undercutting
name: Dr Joe Todd
institution: Geography & Sustainable Development, University of St Andrews
description:  The release of icebergs from glaciers which flow into the ocean ("calving"), is a process which is highly sensitive to climate change, and a possible major contributor to future sea level rise. We use the "HiDEM" model, which represents glaciers as connected ice blocks, to simulate how iceberg calving is affected by climate processes. This animation shows an underwater view of the response of Store Glacier, west Greenland, to undercutting of the glacier front by warm ocean water. This warm water melts glacier ice, with fastest melt rates at the base. This melt undercutting destabilises the glacier and promotes iceberg calving. This is a major source of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet. At the front, Store Glacier is half a kilometre thick, and each cube of ice in this animation contains enough ice to fill 3 Olympic-size swimming pools.
