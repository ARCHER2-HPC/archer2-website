title: Transonic shock buffet on large transport aircraft
name: Dr Fulvio Sartor
institution: University of Liverpool School of Engineering
description: Transonic flow field around a wing-body configuration representative of a large transport aircraft at flight conditions. The image is a snapshot of an unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulation run on ARCHER.<br><br>The aircraft surface is coloured by the air pressure. The slices indicate the velocity field in the supersonic zone of the flow. On the left wing, vortical structures represent the large-scale turbulent air generated by the separated flow due to the shock wave interacting with the boundary layer.<br><br>Streamlines coloured by the velocity magnitude give an idea of the flow direction around the aircraft.
