title: Numerical experiments with 3D plume dispersal over deep-sea mining site
name: Dr. Dmitry Aleynik
institution: Scottish Association for Marine Science / Physics and Technology
description:  Harvesting of ferro-manganese nodules deep below the surface in the Central Tropical Pacific will generate plumes of suspended sediment  with inevitable ecologically harmful long-lasting impact to the fragile, diverse, unique and largest abyssal benthic community on earth.  Alongside concessions licenses, which have tripled in the past 6 years, a tool to assist spatial preservation planning is urgently  required.  To estimate plumes advection, the flow field was computed on ARCHER using an MIT-gcm general circulation model, forced by  tides and the observed (in spring 2013) currents at the proposed mining site in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone.<br /> The figure shows a neutrally buoyant tracer spreading over a 3D bathymetry with colours indicating the concentration of dissolved  matter (a) and overlaid with vertical mixing strength (K<sub>z</sub>) after 19 days.  Particulate matter plume contains half a million  individual particles either suspended in a water (magenta) or settled on the seabed (pale) and charted on the same date (b).
