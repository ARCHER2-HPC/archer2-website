title: Numerical simulation of tidal flow past a single marine power turbine
name: Dr Christian T. Jacobs
institution: Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London
description:  A visualisation of the water velocity from a numerical simulation of tidal flow past a marine power turbine. Lighter colours represent a higher velocity. As a tidal wave flows past the 5 m x 20 m turbine (outlined in white), a turbulent wake forms behind it and vortex shedding is clearly visible. The numerical simulation predicts how much power will be extracted by the turbine with a given set of conditions (e.g. placement of the turbine and incoming flow speed) to help maximise the efficiency of turbine arrays/'farms' developed in the future. The simulation was performed on Archer using a computational fluid dynamics code called Firedrake-Fluids.
