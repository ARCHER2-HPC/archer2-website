title: Vortical Lines evolving in a turbulent jet flow from a round nozzle
name: Mr Vassilis Ioannou
institution: Aeronautics, Imperial College London
description:  This image shows the evolution of a turbulent high-speed air jet ejected from a round nozzle in slow-moving air. The flow near the nozzle-exit is based on large-scale annular structures whereas the flow further downstream is highly turbulent with structures over a wide range of scales.<br /> 	 The turbulent jet is a canonical flow representative of many practical applications such as, e.g., propulsion jets of aircraft engines, hazardous toxic gases released from smokestacks, wastewater discharge from pipes into rivers. Our aim is to manipulate the flow structures at the exit of the nozzle in order to achieve noise mitigation and mixing enhancement.<br />       The data was produced by a high-fidelity simulation for which the equations describing the fluid motions were solved with the open-source flow solver Incompact3d (www.incompact3d.com). The simulation was performed on ARCHER in a domain using more than 800 million nodes on 8,192 cores.
