title: Chaotic fluid dynamics
name: Dr Phil Browne
institution: School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Reading
description:  Many computational models are chaotic, meaning that small differences lead to wildly different results. This is famously true of earth's atmosphere and other fluid dynamics problems. In order to test ways to forecast the weather and climate, we often use smaller models with the same properties. This images shows one such model that simulated fluid flowing on a torus. The colours represent the intensity of rotation, and you can see areas which look similar to weather systems such as hurricanes or typhoons that occur in the atmosphere. Areas of intricate detail where the flow has sharp small-scale features are where we concentrate our efforts to ensure they are well represented, in order so that we can make the most reliable predictions. Archer allows us to run multiple high-resolution simulations at once to quantify the uncertainty in our predictions.
