title: Schematic representation of an ultrafast X-ray scattering event. The image represents the X-ray experiment along with the equations necessary to carry out the HPC simulation of the problem.

description:  In our research group we are interested in ultrafast imaging, i.e. the art of visualizing chemical events as they happen in real time using state-of-the-art simulations and experiments. In terms of the simulations, we rely on HPC resources such as Archer. Our simulations have two elements; the first is a quantum dynamics simulation of the quantum evolution of the nuclear and electronic motion in a molecule excited by an ultra short optical laser pulse. The second consists of advanced calculations that aim to predict the X-ray scattering signal obtained using a X-ray free-electron laser.<br />		The image tries to evoke the critical link between experiment, theory, and computations within this procedure. While the colourful pictures rely on the real experiment, the equations behind show the physical frame we have used to explain the whole process. In this image, schematic representations of the molecule and false-colour X-ray and electron beams are used to illustrate the concepts of real pump-probe diffraction experiments.<br />		Image has been created using only Adobe Illustrator 2017 and Adobe Photoshop 2017.
