title: Secondary currents in turbulent channel flow over streamwise ridges
name: Dr Oleksandr Zhdanov
institution: University of Glasgow, James Watt School of Engineering
description: The image shows two pairs of time-averaged secondary current vortices formed over streamwise-aligned triangular ridges placed on a smooth wall. These results were obtained from direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow performed on the UK National Supercomputing Service ARCHER2. The secondary currents are visualised with isosurfaces of swirl strength coloured by streamwise vorticity. Although the ridge height is only 8% of the channel half-height, the spacing between ridges is of the order of the channel half-height resulting in pronounced secondary currents that occupy a significant part of the channel. Due to their large extent, they affect the entire flow invalidating Townsendâ€™s hypothesis for the outer-layer similarity of rough-wall turbulence. Understanding the role of secondary currents in momentum and energy transfer will lead to more accurate models for drag prediction and facilitate development of a framework for the identification, prediction, and control of secondary currents in engineering and environmental applications.
