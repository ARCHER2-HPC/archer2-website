title: Time-elapsed images of diffusion of tracer particles during turbulent convection. 
name: Dr Jane Pratt, A. Busse and W.C. Mueller
institution: University of Exeter, Department of Physics
description:  In natural systems like stellar interiors and planetary atmospheres flows are not constrained by convection rolls or boundary  layers. As well as the structure of plumes in a flow, heat transfer is highly dependent on a fluid's Prandtl number, the ratio of  viscosity to thermal diffusivity.  In the solar convection zone thermal diffusivity dominates, and Prandtl numbers are estimated to  be 3 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than can be achieved by modern simulations. A theoretical understanding of how turbulent heat  transfer changes as the Prandtl number is lowered is key to effectively modelling convection. We have developed new methods of characterizing  the heat transfer in and around plumes using higher order statistics and Lagrangian tracer particles. We calculate statistics of heat transfer  from pseudospectral simulations of incompressible homogeneous Boussinesq hydrodynamic convection for the wide range of Prandtl numbers.
