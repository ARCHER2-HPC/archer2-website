title: Hydrogen partitioning during Earth's core-mantle differentiation
name: Dr Li Yunguo
institution: University College London
description:  The ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories shows that most hydrogen atoms (white balls) stay in the core material (liquid Fe), while few go into the mantle material (silicate melt) at conditions simulating the Earth's core-mantle differentiation process. This simulation clearly demonstrates the siderophile ("iron-loving") nature of hydrogen, and implies that the Earth's core can be a reservoir of hydrogen.
