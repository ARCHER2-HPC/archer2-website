title: Propagation of a high frequency sound wave emanating from the fan of an aircraft engine 
name: Mr Romain Futrzynski
institution: KTH Farkost och Flyg, Stockholm
description:  The image shows the low and high pressure regions, respectively in blue and red, of a sound wave emanating from an aircraft  engine's fan. Note how the curvature of the engine's nacelle distorts the wave as it propagates away from the fan. The acoustic  field was simulated using the relatively new yet efficient "wave expansion method". Large calculations on Archer allowed to compute  the precise sound level created by waves of many frequencies, up to several kilohertz, within a seven-meter radius around the fan.  Such simulations simplify the integration of acoustics in the optimization of the engine's design, and should lead to quieter  airplanes. Isosurfaces of the calculated pressure were created in Paraview, and rendered together with the nacelle using Blender.
