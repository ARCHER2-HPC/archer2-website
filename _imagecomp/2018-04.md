title: Rectangular nanoparticles in a diblock copolymer mixture.
name: Mr Javier Diaz
institution: University of Lincoln, School of Mathematics and Physics
description:  Rectangular colloids are dispersed into a mixture of diblock copolymers, which is a chain-like molecule in which two species - A and B monomers - are joined together. For this reason, a periodic ordered structure is observed. In this simulation performed in ARCHER, rectangular particles have an affinity towards the interface between the blue and yellow phase. Because the total length of the nanoparticles is larger than the interface present in the system, the colloids drive the system into creating smaller domains, forming the grid-like structure that is found in this simulation. The rectangular nanoparticles 'fit' into the interface by orienting along the it, which is a characteristic of anisotropic particles that would not be present in circular particles.
