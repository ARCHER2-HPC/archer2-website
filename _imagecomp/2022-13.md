title: The organisation of protein islands on the E.coli bacterial outer membrane
name: Dr Dheeraj Prakaash
institution: Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford
description: Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative bacterium. The outer membrane, which surrounds the bacterium, is composed of proteins (shown in orange in the initial magnification; red-green (low-high) depth gradient in the final magnification) embedded within lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules in the outer leaflet (yellow and light blue layers) and phospholipids in the inner leaflet (dark blue layer). LPS acts as a barrier restricting the entry of a large number of molecules such as antibiotics. Our simulations contributed to a multidisciplinary study which showed the spatial organisation of the outer membrane to be different from textbook models. Rather than a uniform distribution of proteins and lipids, there are distinct regions enriched in proteins (termed ‘islands’) and regions occupied largely by lipids. The magnified images were rendered using Visual Molecular Dynamics while the remainder of the image was created using Inkscape. Molecular Dynamics simulations on ARCHER2 were performed using the Gromacs 2021 package.
