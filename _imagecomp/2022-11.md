title: Marine plastic pollution in the Indian Ocean
name: Noam Vogt-Vincent
institution: Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford
description: Marine plastic pollution is an enormous environmental problem facing our ocean. There are many remote islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, many of which are sparsely populated with little-to-no local sources of pollution, yet are accumulating enormous quantities of plastic waste on their beaches. This animation shows the results of a simulation incorporating plastic waste entering the ocean from both coasts and beaches, and the effects of ocean currents, winds, waves, debris sinking, and beaching. Although some waste is generated within the western Indian Ocean, most pollution reaching remote western Indian Ocean islands may actually originate from southeast Asia, transported over thousands of kilometres through westward ocean currents and monsoonal winds. If you look carefully, you can also see a seasonal cycle driven by the monsoonal winds, where debris is most likely to reach more southerly islands in Seychelles during the months of January-April.
