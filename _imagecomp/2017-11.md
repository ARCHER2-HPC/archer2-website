title: Time-evolution of CS2 photodissociation upon UV excitation, visualised as nuclear density plots of the sulfur atoms generated from quantum dynamics simulations carried out on Archer. (L) After 10 fs (R) after 500 fs.

description: Rapid developments in ultrafast laser technology allow experimentalists to study fundamental chemical reactions in unprecedented detail, using extremely short, intense pulses of laser light as a "camera" on the atomic and molecular scale. However, the data generated by such experiments is difficult to interpret directly. Thus, theoretical simulations are a necessity. The submitted image comes from a joint experimental/theoretical study examining the behaviour of the CS<sub>2</sub> molecule after excitation by a UV laser pulse, using state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical techniques. After absorbing a photon of UV light, CS<sub>2</sub> undergoes complex nuclear and electronic motion resulting in breakage of one of the carbon-sulfur bonds. Dynamics simulations, reliant on HPC facilities such as Archer, have aided understanding of this process, and here we show two snapshots in time of the density distributions corresponding to the two sulphur atoms, which are delocalized according to the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.
