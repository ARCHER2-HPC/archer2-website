title: Laser pulse undergoing self-focusing effects during the penetration into the underdense frontal region of a pre-expanded plasma target.

description:  This movie depicts the electric field of an intense laser pulse (blue and red volumes) right before the laser is reflected by an overdense  plasma (blue rear surface). The laser has penetrated the frontal underdense plasma region (transparent yellow), where it has 				 coupled to the electrons heating them. Due to the collective non-linear effects of the plasma, the laser undergoes self-focusing 				 within this underdense region. This is seen in the cross-section of the pulse (14 secs) where a clear pinching of the pulse is 				 observed. This leads to an increase of the laser intensity on target, which in turn produces an enhanced electron heating. <br>				 The simulation, performed with the Particle-In-Cell code OSIRIS on ARCHER, uses laser and plasma conditions modelled after 				 the L3IA experiment at CNR (Pisa, Italy). This work is used to understand and improve the generation of hot electrons 				 in laser-plasma interactions, vital for laser-plasma based ion acceleration.
