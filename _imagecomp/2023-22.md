title: Aerofoil Turbulence Generation using Vortex Generators
name: Clinton Naicker
institution: Brunel University London - Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
description: The picture shows Q-criterion iso-surfaces coloured by mean velocity magnitude, demonstrating the natural transition to turbulent flow for the clean aerofoil (left) and the forced transition to turbulent flow (right). Wind tunnel experiments are limited by the inflow velocity and size of the test section. Therefore, to test the effectiveness of noise reduction mechanisms, lower speed experiments use "tripping" to force the transition of laminar flow to turbulent flow. To make a like-for-like comparison with the experiments run at the Brunel Aeroacoustics Lab, CFD analysis was carried out at a Reynolds number of 200,000 on an aerofoil section making use of a "zigzag" type trip. The Large-Eddy Simulation was conducted using OpenFOAM v2212 on ARCHER2. Postprocessing was carried out in ParaView.
