title: Chiral molecules on a surface can be separated under the presence of an  external  oscillating field
name: Dr David Abbasi Perez
institution: King's College London, Department of Physics 
description:  Chiral molecules are, like our hands, specular images and non superimposable. This is important for living beings, as one molecule can heal us, while its specular image may have devastating effects. They have identical chemical and physical properties, but different biological activity. This is why is important to separate them but is also a very difficult task. We propose a method that can control the diffusion of these molecules on a surface, once they are equally oriented, by applying an external field. The image represents two chiral molecules diffusing toward opposite directions under the influence of the field, represented by the blue and orange background. Many density functional theory calculations were carried out on Archer, and then we applied a kinetic Monte Carlo technique to simulate the movement of the molecules over long times. The image was created with the open source codes Jmol, Blender, Gimp and Krita.
