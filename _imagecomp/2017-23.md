title: Simulation of the magnetization dynamics of a magnetic vortex after laser excitation
name: Richard Evans
institution: Department of Physics, University of York
description: Confined magnetic materials are able to support complex topological structures. A magnetic vortex is the natural ground state of a permalloy nanodot, where the magnetization direction swirls continuously around the core. When excited by laser pulses, magnetic materials respond on the sub-picosecond timescale but their behaviour is hard to predict and understand. Here we 		have simulated the dynamics of a magnetic vortex in a 70 nm diameter nanodot after a 50 femtosecond 		laser pulse using atomistic spin dynamics as implemented in the VAMPIRE code. The laser heating causes a large number of vortex nuclei to form on the picosecond timescale as the vortex state attempts to reform after the laser pulse. The simulations show that topology has almost no effect on the dynamics at the ultrashort timescales, but can play a dominating role on the 100 picosecond timescale. This may lead to new ways to process and store information at Terahertz frequencies.
