title: Artistic representation of an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment
name: Mr Nelson Yeung
institution: University of Warwick, Physics Department
description: An experiment that measures the energy and momentum of electrons in tungsten diselenide. The gold coloured rods and blocks are electrodes made from platinum, which are connected to a power source. The green block is boron nitride, with 3 layers of 2D tungsten diselenide sitting on top of it. The grey atoms at the top are graphene, which is in contact with the electrode. This setup is essentially a capacitor which gives rise to the accumulation of charge in an area of the tungsten diselenide when a voltage is applied to the electrodes. A focused ultraviolet beam is fired at the tungsten diselenide which causes electrons (red balls) to eject from it. The energy and momentum of the ejected electrons are then measured. Computer simulations were used to simulate the results of this experiment.
