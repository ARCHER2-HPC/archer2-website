title: Vapour Shielding
description: When multiple droplets evaporate in close proximity, the surrounding vapour accumulates and suppresses their evaporation. Because vapour diffuses more slowly than droplets evaporate, this accumulation creates a shielding effect that reduces evaporation at the droplet edges facing neighbouring droplets. As a result, the cooling effect at the droplet interface becomes asymmetric for corner droplets in the array, breaking symmetry and driving azimuthal flow. In contrast, the central droplet experiences suppression uniformly from all sides, producing a more symmetric convective flow. These findings are obtained from full-scale direct numerical phase-field simulations carried out on ARCHER2 using our in-house code <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpls/">TPLS</a>.
