title: Turbulent structures and coolant mixing downstream of a single-row of cooling holes
name: Christopher Ellis
institution: Loughborough University, Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering
description:  The image presents the Large Eddy Simulation solution of complex turbulent mixing of coolant downstream of a single-row of cooling holes. Turbulent structures are coloured by cooling effectiveness and the centreline plane displays the turbulent velocity field. Simulation results are produced using OpenFOAM, an open source Computational Fluid Dynamics package. A total of 80 million cells are used to resolve the turbulent flow. The present simulation is used to provide accurate results of the surface coolant spread for combustor liner applications and to improve the accuracy of low fidelity methodologies to provide cheap and efficient cooling solutions.
