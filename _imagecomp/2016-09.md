title: The birth of a footprint
name: Dr Peter Falkingham
institution: Natural Sciences &amp; Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University
description:  This image is of three stages of footprint formation, simulated by combining bi-planar X-ray data of a guineafowl walking over a sand-like substrate with a Discrete Element simulation of the substrate.  X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) was used to capture the motions of the leg and foot in a living animal. LIGGGHTS was then used to model the substrate, simulating grains of 1 mm diameter. Poppy seeds were used as the substrate as they behave like dry sand but are less dense, allowing X-rays to pass through.<br /> This work has allowed us to link features of footprints - both at and below the surface - with motions of the foot, and is now being applied to understanding footprints made by long extinct dinosaurs.
