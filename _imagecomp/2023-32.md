title: Floating wind platform in wave
description: loating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT) play an important role in offshore renewable energy utilization, contributing to the net-zero target. This simulation conducts a preliminary study on the floating foundation of FOWT in regular waves using an open-source CFD tool (OpenFOAM-ESI). The built-in wave generation and overset mesh technique are adopted to create regular waves and handle the floater's dynamic response. The mesh near the floater (i.e., inner region), generated using meshing software ChopMesh, perfectly fits the structure's surface with excellent quality. Edges of the inner region match the structure's outline, ensuring a smooth transition.
