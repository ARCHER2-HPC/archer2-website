title: Swirl-stabilised jet fuel spray flame becoming extinguished
name:  Miss Jenna Foale
institution: University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering
description:  This video shows a 2D cross-sectional cut of a 3D transient lab-scale kerosene spray flame. The liquid spray droplets, coloured with temperature T (Kelvin), vaporize from the heat of the combustion reaction zone, releasing fuel mass fraction shown as POSF10325. The fuel burns near the swirling atmospheric temperature air shown in black coming from the annulus around the bluff body. The 3D stoichiometric iso-surface of the flame, coloured with OH species mass fraction, is shown dancing above the bluff body. The black spots on the iso-surface show lack of OH, thus lack of chemical reaction, indicating the occurrence of local extinctions along the flame surface. The iso-surface shrinks as the flame nears global extinction. The calculations were performed on Archer using OpenFOAM with the Conditional Moment Closure combustion model.
