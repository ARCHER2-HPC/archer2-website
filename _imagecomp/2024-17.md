title: The Shape of Water
description: The still image from the video shows "tsunami" waves propagating in a shallow water tank, 1.8 m in length, as a result of a gas-particle collapse. This research is part of "Boiling Point," a collaboration between the Geophysical Flow Lab at the University of Edinburgh and Olivier Desjardins at Cornell University. The aim of this research is to simulate three-phase flows to understand how volcanic flows can generate multi-hazards, including tsunami generation caused by landslides and pyroclastic flows entering water bodies. The simulation uses Desjardins' multiphase flow solver, NGA2, a high-fidelity Euler-Lagrange solver where fluid-particle interactions are two-way coupled (solving Navier-Stokes equations), and particle behaviour is resolved using the discrete-element method (DEM). In this study, our first goal is to validate our simulations by reproducing laboratory experiments and understanding the "Shape of Water" waves before progressing to more complex scenarios involving heat and phase change.
