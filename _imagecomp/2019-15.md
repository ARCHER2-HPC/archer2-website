title: Development and interaction of turbulent structures downstream of a single-row of cooling holes
name: Christopher Ellis
institution: Loughborough University, Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering
description:  The video presents the Large Eddy Simulation solution of complex turbulent mixing of coolant downstream of a single-row of cooling holes. Development and interaction of the coolant flow with the mainstream can be seen as the flow convects downstream. Turbulent structures are coloured by the temperature of the fluid showing the mixing between the 300K mainstream flow and 150K coolant flow. Simulation results are produced using OpenFOAM, an open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics package. A total of 21 million cells are used to resolve the turbulent flow. The present simulation is used to provide accurate results of the surface coolant spread for combustor liner applications and to improve the accuracy of low fidelity methodologies to provide cheap and efficient cooling solutions.
