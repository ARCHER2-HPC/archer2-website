title: The reflected shock-wave
name: Dr Jian Fang
institution: Scientific computing department, STFC Daresbury Laboratory
description: The animation shows the results from a direct-numerical simulation of the cold supersonic flow in the combustor of a model scramjet. The cavity on the bottom wall is to hold the flame. The turbulent coherent structures are visualised with the isosurfaces of swirling strength, Î»ci, coloured with local temperature. The shock-waves/compression-waves are represented with the isosurfaces of pressure gradient. It is interesting to see that the impingement of the shear-layer with the ramp of the cavity creates an oblique shock-wave, which bounces between the upper and bottom walls.
