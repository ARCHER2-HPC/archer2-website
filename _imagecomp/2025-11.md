title: New look into Taylor-Green Vortices
description: The visualisation shows a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of Taylor-Green vortices. The Taylor-Green vortex test case is a common setup for benchmarking and validating CFD solvers. The flow is initialised with sin waves velocities. Vortices decay over time showing the different scales of turbulence. The simulation at the centre of the visualisation was performed by ASiMoV-ccs (https://github.com/asimovpp/asimov-ccs), a CFD and combustion code designed for large scale simulations.<br>The simulations was run using 16 nodes for 20h on ARCHER2. The data was then pre-processed using ParaView to compute the Q-criterion (quantity calculated from the velocity field and highlighting vortices). Finally the scene setup and all its components were designed using Blender.
