title: 2-D momentum plots of electron rescattering from fluorine anions
name: Dr Andrew Brown
institution: Queen's University Belfast
description: 2-D momentum distributon of electrons driven by strong-field photodetachment of a Flourine anion. The large circular rings are a clear signature of electron rescattering, wherein the electron is pulled first away from the ion and then smashed back into it, gaining excess energy from the field and probing the atomic structure and dynamics of the residual target. Previous model calculatons failed to find any evidence of rescattering, but the massively expanded capabilites of ARCHER allow us to model the electron dynamics in greater detail than ever before.
