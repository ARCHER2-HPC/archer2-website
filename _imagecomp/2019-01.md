title: The chain-melted phase now understood from simulating potassium. Chains can be seen flowing through the host-guest structure.
name:  Victor Naden Robinson
institution: The University of Edniburgh, Physics and Astronomy
description:  Some elements form a host-guest structure with 1D chains under compression, and when heated these chains can "melt". Here we attempted to simulate this phenomenon to understand the nature of this order-disorder transition. Starting from ab initio methods we developed a force field in order to simulate a large number of chains and map out the correlation between different chains and along individual chains, revealing the full 3D nature of the order-disorder transition.
