title: Progressive zoom into a cross-section of a three-dimensional simulation of Rayleigh-Taylor convection using the Elliptical Parcel-in-Cell method.
description: We have developed a three-dimensional model to simulate fluid dynamics using ellipsoidal parcels. <br> These parcels can deform, split and merge to capture the effects of mixing on the flow.  <br> The parcels carry all the information needed to compute the flow evolution in these simulations. <br> The simulation shown here starts with a warm fluid below a cold fluid. This unstable stratification leads to the development of a convective, turbulent flow. The cross-section shows that structures  in the temperature field develop over a range of scales. The individual ellipses obtained from theintersection of the shown cross-section with the surrounding ellispoidal parcels are visualised.
