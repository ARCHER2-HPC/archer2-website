title: Molecular Dynamics simulation of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle sintering process in flame-synthesized nanoaerosol system.
name: Qian Mao
institution: Center for Combustion Energy and Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University
description:  TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle is widely used as semiconductor, dye-sensitized solar cell, catalyst support and so on. Flame synthesis is an effective way to produce pure anatase nanoparticles with diameter below 10nm. During the synthesis process, particles experience nucleation, surface growth, collision and sintering. Among them, sintering is an important stage to determine the final structure and size. Here, we use Lammps software to carry out molecule dynamics simulation to study the dynamic sintering process after off-center collision and unequal-sized sintering. Two interesting phenomenon have been found. One is phase transformation from anatase to rutile in the sintering after the off-center collision, the other is packaging meaning atoms from an amorphous smaller particle spread uniformly on the surface layer of the bigger particle. This image shows this dynamic process. The simulations were partly performed on ARCHER funded under the EPSRC project "UK Consortium on Mesoscale Engineering Sciences (UKCOMES)" (Grant No. EP/L00030X/1).
