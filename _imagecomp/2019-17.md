title: Passive scalar intensity slice extracted from a three-dimensional fluid flow field of a temporal jet
name: Dr Jean-Paul Mollicone
institution: Imperial College London, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
description:  The image shows the passive scalar intensity on a slice extracted from a three-dimensional turbulent flow field. The results are computed using direct numerical simulation (DNS) by running the in-house code Sparkle on Archer whilst the open-source visualisation software Visit is used to generate the image. The research involves theoretical analysis and DNS to study the dynamics of turbulent jets in a variety of conditions. The aim is to gain detailed physical insights of the multi-scale dynamics at the turbulent/non-turbulent interface of such flows by using a rigorous and novel tool, namely the generalised Kolmogorov/Yaglom equations, that accounts for in-homogeneity and anisotropy in turbulent flows. This allows to quantify the processes that occur at different scales and locations at the interface and in the fluid domain. As a result, new, more accurate modelling techniques can be developed for simulating large-scale turbulent flows needed by the practical engineering community.
