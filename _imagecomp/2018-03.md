title: Spatiotemporally Coupled Laser Pulse Compression
name: Mr Thomas Wilson
institution: University of Strathclyde, Physics Department
description:  The manipulation of intense lasers can be challenging. Solid optic equipment can be damaged, and shaping pulses to particular profiles can be expensive. However, plasmas offer many options to shape and manipulate high power lasers, having highly tunable optical properties and no damage threshold.<br> This image shows the results of a 3D particle-in-cell simulation of a spatiotemporally coupled laser pulse compression. The 3D rendered surfaces show snapshots of the laser pulse, coloured according to the amplitude. <br> The lower plane shows the intensity distribution through each snapshot, and the rear plane shows the plasma electron density at the the final snapshot. <br> The pulse is compressed uniformly in all directions down to only a single wavelength, accompanied by a huge increase in intensity, over 150 times the initial. Further attempts to compress the pulse cause it to collapse. However, the pulse remnant re-emerges from the collapse site, and even undergoes further collapses.
