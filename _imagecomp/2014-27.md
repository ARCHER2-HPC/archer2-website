title: Streamlines illustrating the temperature distribution and emergence of azimuthal currents within the flow of an irregular 3D liquid droplet undergoing phase change
name: Dr Pedro J. S&aacute;enz
institution: University of Edinburgh Institute for Materials and Processes
description:  This image illustrates the flow and temperature distribution within an evaporating liquid droplet with elliptical contact area. For the first time, deformed drops have been simulated in three-dimensions, investigation which has elucidated the spontaneous emergence of previously-unknown azimuthal currents playing an essential role on the drop's flow and heat transfer mechanism. Understanding the dynamics of an evaporating droplet is a fundamental problem with a broad range of application, such as the development of new techniques for early diagnosis of several life-threatening diseases based on the pattern formation from drying drops of blood. The data depicted in the figure is the result of seven coupled nonlinear equations simultaneously solved at more than 8 million points, herculean task which would have required years to complete without ARCHER.
