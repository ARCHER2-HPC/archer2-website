title: Flow around a tilt-rotor aircraft
name: Antonio Jimenez Garcia
institution: Aerospace Department, CFD group, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow
description:  This research introduces a novel approach to compute the flow around a tilt-rotor using computational fluid dynamics  techniques. The image shows the flow-field of the ERICA tilt-rotor using the HMB solver of Glasgow University. The  tilt-rotor technology has been successfully employed in the United States with the V-22 Osprey. However, it has been  limited to just military applications. The combination of take-off/landing capabilities of helicopters with the high  cruise speed of proprotors, makes this hybrid configuration aircraft an attractive concept for civil applications. However,  civil tilt-rotor designs need to be quieter due to its environmental impacts on nearby communities, as well as, more efficient  than military ones in terms of fuel consumptions. This project assesses and investigates the aerodynamic interference between  the rotor and different components of civil tilt-rotor. This research provides more insight about tilt-rotor blade designs, and  also assist in the development of the first civil tilt-rotor.
