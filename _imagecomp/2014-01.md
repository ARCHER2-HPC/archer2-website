title: Magnificently magnifying

description:  Rocks, sand and mud all have in common that they are made up of minerals. Calcite is one such mineral. It's what chalk and the beloved cliffs of Dover are made of. Calcite can affect the quality of groundwater by making it "hard", taking up or releasing contaminants. How calcite interacts with water can be analysed at the atomic scale using ARCHER.<br>  <br>    The background image is a snapshot of a simulation of the calcite mineral surface in water. The blue V-shapes are water molecules. The green, red and grey balls are atoms in the calcite surface. Water near the calcite surface is structured, almost like ice, in rows above the green calcium atoms. Information on this nearly frozen water is to predict the surface charge (inset graph) and reactivity of calcite towards contaminants and how fast calcite forms or dissolves. As such, ARCHER works as a magnificent magnifying glass.<i></i>
