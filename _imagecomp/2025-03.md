title: Pathways of freshwater in the Ganges delta
description: These maps show pathways which freshwater takes through the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India. A lagrangian particle tracking approach was used to trak waters released in the red area at the far north of the domain, then allowed to travel freely down the network of river channels.<br><br> The top row is from the 'wet season' in Septmber, and the bottom row is for the 'dry sesason' in March. The fast flows in the wet season are seen to wash partcles rapidly down the delta, forming a freshwater plume offshore. In the dry season, slower flows mean the particles do not travel so far.<br><br> The numerical models generation the underlying current velocity data were generated by a configuration of FVCOM run on ARCHER2.
