title: Transparancy of graphene to an electric field
name: Mr Peter Rice
institution: Atomistic Simulation Centre,  Queen's University Belfast
description:  The image depicts the "transparency" of graphene to an electric field. We performed calculations that will  significantly help in the development of a range of future applications. In this way, we will be able to search  for the right combinations of different 2D crystals while reducing the need for expensive lab work and test trials.  The results where only made possible with the resources available to us on Archer!
