title: Tunnels throughout the extracellular domain of Patched1
name:  T. Bertie Ansell
institution: Oxford University
description:  The Patched1 receptor is a key tumour suppressor membrane protein in the Hedgehog signalling pathway. Recent structural and biochemical studies suggest Patched1 may function as a putative sterol transporter in order to inhibit the Class F G-protein coupled receptor Smoothened. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the Patched1 extracellular domain, bound to a cholesterol molecule, were performed under ARCHER HecBioSim allocated computational time. These simulations were used to assess formation of dynamic tunnels throughout the extracellular domain which we demonstrated collapse upon binding of Sonic Hedgehog ligand cholesterol attachment (Rudolf et al. 2019, Nat. Chem. Biol). The image shows an overlay of Patched1 extracellular domain tunnels on the full length Patched1 protein. We identify tunnels which egress proximal to the membrane region and through two novel side portals. Tunnels are shown as midpoint through the tunnel and coloured by tunnel cluster.
