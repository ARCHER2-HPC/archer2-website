title: Turbulence-Generated Noise from a Serrated Nozzle Jet
name: Zhong-Nan Wang
institution: Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge
description:  This image shows the broadband noise generated by a turbulent jet from serrated nozzle. The nozzle serration is used to break up turbulent structures into small scales for noise reduction. The q-criterion shows the turbulent structures and background grey-scale contours shows emitted acoustic waves. Multi-scale phenomena can be seen from perspectives of both turbulence and acoustics. Acoustic waves are generated at different locations in the near field and interfere as propagating to the far field.
