title: Physiological Electro-mechanics Simulation on a Four-chamber Hear
name: Marina Strocchi
institution: Department of  Biomedical Engineering, King's College London
description:  The video shows simulated electrical activation (left) and mechanical contraction (right) of the heart.  High-fidelity computational models of the heart are increasingly used to improve our understanding of human pathology and pathophysiology. Our research aims to build computer models for cardiac activation and contraction providing physiological activation and contraction dynamics. The simulation shown in the video includes fundamental features needed to simulate realistic cardiac function such as the Purkinje network (red network on the left), which leads to a fast activation of the bottom chambers of the heart,  and the effect of the pericardium, a 'bag' containing the heart and limiting its motion. With our models, we are able to simulate therapy delivery in order to improve patient selection and optimise response to treatment.
