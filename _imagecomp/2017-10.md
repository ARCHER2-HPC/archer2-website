title: Scattered showers - an ARCHER-enabled view of the water-cycle.
name: Andrew Coward
institution: Marine Systems Modelling
description:  Comprehensive models of the Earth System are key to understanding our climate and its variability. The ARCHER supercomputing service provides the capability and capacity for UK scientists to explore the interactions between key components at unprecedented resolutions. The main sequence shows a simulated year from a high resolution, coupled, ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere model. <br />		There is a lot of meteorology and oceanography to observe in the movie. Most evident is the difference in time and space scales between the three components (atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice). At first glance the atmosphere does not appear to be greatly influenced by the ocean conditions (in contrast, it clearly feels the presence of topographic features such as the Rockies). Indeed, in comparison the ocean hardly appears to be moving (but it is). The ocean's influence is more subtle, providing energy to feed atmospheric instability and memory in the system to affect long term variability.
