title: Turbulent Wake Generated by a Square Prism
name: Mr. Felipe Alves Portela
institution: Aeronautics, Imperial College London
description:  The image illustrates how a flow past a bluff body gives rise to a turbulent wake displaying a wealth of scales of motion within the fluid. The iso-surfaces represent coherent structures within the flow and the lines are stream-lines of the fluctuating velocity.  Large structures aligned with the body's axis dominate the motion of fluid while smaller scales arise and interact with each other, the smallest of which destroying the energy associated with the turbulent motion. The mechanisms by which this energy is exchanged between the different scales and within the flow is not well understood yet and is the matter of ongoing research. Archer's computational power provides the means to simulate realistic flows and extract information which is often unobtainable in laboratory experiments. The present image was processed in ParaView and the data was obtained using an in-house code which ran in Archer for about 10000 CPU-hours.
