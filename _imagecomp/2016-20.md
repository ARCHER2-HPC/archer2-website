title: Electric field generated by the heart in the human body at the beginning of a heartbeat.
name:  Dr Alfonso Bueno Orovio
institution: Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford
description:  The figure shows the electric field generated by the heart in the human body during the initiation of a heartbeat. In the  heart, the red colour indicates the areas that have been electrically activated, while those in blue are areas yet to be  excited. In the body, the streamlines show the electric field produced by such an electrical activity, coloured by electric  voltage potential. This can be measured for diagnosis in the clinic in the form of an electrocardiogram. The use of ARCHER is  allowing us the investigation of multiple disease conditions in the human heart, to augment the information that we can obtain  from these signals for a better diagnosis of patients, and to improve their tailoring of therapy.
