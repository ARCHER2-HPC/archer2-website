title: Vertical planes of streamwise velocity for a supersonic boundary-layer.
name: Dr Andrea Sansica
institution: University of Southampton, Department of Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics
description:  High-fidelity direct numerical simulations represent the richest source of information in computational fluid dynamics. The computing effort needed to resolve all the significant spatial and temporal scales is however enormous and often prohibitive. The computational resources available in ARCHER allow numerical meshes of hundreds of millions of points and made possible to study fundamental flow configurations that only 10-15 years ago were simply unimaginable.<br /> <br />  The interest is here focused on the impingement location effect of a shock-wave onto a supersonic boundary-layer that is experiencing transition to turbulence at a Mach number of 1.5. The presence of the shock-wave accelerates transition and different structures of interaction exist depending on the nature of the boundary-layer at the impingement location.
