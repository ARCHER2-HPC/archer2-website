title: Evolution of a transient plasma structure
name: Mr George Holt
institution: University of Strathclyde, Physics Department
description:  Ultrashort lasers have been major drivers of discovery and innovation for the past several decades, and continue to be to this day. By colliding high-power laser pulses in plasma, the particles can be arranged into a fascinating range of three-dimensional patterns that have useful properties. They can be used to manipulate high-power laser beams, and as compact light sources. This video shows how an initially homogeneous plasma can evolve into an intricate structure. The data was generated using the EPOCH code deployed on ARCHER2, which has enabled exquisitely detailed, high-resolution simulations.
