title: Star-crossed lovers&colon; Flame quenching by wall
name: Mr. Jiawei Lai
institution: Newcastle University
description:  Cooling of walls is necessary to ensure structural integrity of combustors because the burned gas temperature is often higher than the melting point of the wall. This heat loss through the wall quenches the flame and generate pollutants, while high heat flux due to flame-wall interaction affects the lifespan of combustors. This picture shows interaction of V-shaped turbulent premixed flame with inert top and bottom isothermal walls using a simulation methodology on ARCHER which does not make any physical approximation for simulating the underlying turbulent fluid motion. This data acts as a valuable source for the development of high-fidelity models for Computational Fluid Dynamics calculations which play pivotal roles in the design of next-generation automotive engines, gas turbines and micro-combustors.<br />			Colours represent the magnitudes of vorticity magnitude (background&colon; red-high and white-low) and temperature (isosurface and side view, red-high and blue-low) and fuel mass fraction (lower wall view, red-high and blue-low).
