title: Propagation of a lean hydrogen premixed flame
description: This image shows the temperature distribution in a simulated two-dimensional laminar lean hydrogen premixed flame under ambient conditions, captured at different times during the flame propagation. These snapshots are superimposed to illustrate how the instabilities affects the propagation of the flame over time. The simulation begins from a flat, stable flame, but soon instabilities emerge and multi-scale structures develop in the flame. These instabilities are not observed with typical carbon-based fuel so we investigate how they form and how they influence the flame behaviour. Understanding this process is crucial for advancing hydrogen as a clean alternative to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, since it strongly affects the flame dynamics and has a direct impact on safety and efficiency in combustion systems. This simulation was performed on ARCHER2.
