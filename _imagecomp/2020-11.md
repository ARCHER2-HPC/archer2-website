title: Simulating coastal current separation across scales 
name: Max Holloway
institution: Scottish Association for Marine Science, Physics
description: High-resolution ocean model simulations of sea surface temperature (SST) and current velocities, capturing 				 current separation along the north-east coastline of the island of Rum, on the Scottish west coast. Each panel 				 shows a different simulation using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) zoomed in on the Rum coastline 				 around a fish farm. The resolution increases from left to right, with minimum element 				 sizes of ~200 m (low resolution; panel A), ~30 m (panel B), and 5 m (highest resolution, panel C). The higher 				 resolution simulations are nested within the lower resolution domains. As resolution increases, so does the 				 emergence of new physical features in the flow, including coastal current separation events in the highest 				 resolution domain (panel C). This was undertaken as part of the OffAqua project, which is evaluating the environmental 				 conditions required for the development of offshore aquaculture.
