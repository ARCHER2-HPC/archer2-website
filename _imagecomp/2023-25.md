title: Development of ReaxFF potential to investigate dissolution behaviour of phosphate-based bioglasses
description: Phosphate-based bioglasses (PBGs) have different biomedical applications in hard and soft tissue engineering due to their dissolution properties. The ReaxFF forcefield can describe the formation and dissociation of chemical bonds allowing us to understand the dissolution mechanisms of the glass at atomic level. The parameterization of the ReaxFF parameters of the glasses has been done on the training set of quantum mechanical data including interatomic forces, charge calculation, and different differential energy calculations mostly on small boxes of glasses by GARFfield framework using ARCHER2. We developed ReaxFF parameters of ternary PBGs which include the interaction between phosphorus and calcium atoms. The developed ReaxFF parameters can describe well enough the structural properties of both binary and ternary phosphate-based glasses, consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, with new reparameterization of ReaxFF parameters on training data including the interaction of water molecules with PBGs, we could directly investigate the dissolution behaviors of PBGs.
