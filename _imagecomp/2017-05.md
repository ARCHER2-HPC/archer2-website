title: Density gradient for an airfoil at a Mach number of Ma=0.7 and a Reynolds number of Re=500000.
name: Markus Zauner
institution: AFM Group, University of Southampton
description:  This image shows a schlieren-like illustration of the streamwise density gradient of the flow around a wing-section at a free-stream Mach number of Ma=0.7 and a Reynolds number of Re=500,000. Schlieren pictures are commonly used in experiments to visualise shock waves. In this case, the flow field is generated by a simulation solving the compressible 3D Navier Stokes equations directly. The high resolution of the domain (1 billion grid points) requires more than 30,000 processors for running the simulation on ARCHER. The black regions in the image indicate high local density gradients caused by vortex structures in the wing aft section and the wake. In those regions we can see weak accoustic waves being generated. As the flow goes supersonic on the upper side, we can observe the formation of upstream travelling shock waves as well.
