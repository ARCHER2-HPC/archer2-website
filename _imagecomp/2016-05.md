title: The diffusitivity of protein, lipid and solvent molecules from a simulation with periodicity removed
name: Mr Robin Corey
institution: University of Bristol
description:  SecYEG is a membrane protein which transports other proteins either across or into lipid membranes. An important  aspect of this process is the provision of specificity for the correct protein - the last thing a cell wants is to  accidentally secrete its cytoplasmic proteins.  In 1999, G&#252;nter Blobel was awarded the Nobel prize for showing that  this specificity was conferred by an intrinsic 'signal sequence'.<br /> This image illustrates key movements within SecYEG upon 'unlocking' by the signal sequence, with the protein shown  as cartoon helices in multiple colours and a section of membrane shown as yellow and red spheres. The insertion of a  signal sequence (purple helix) causes a shift in several different locations of SecYEG (dark blue to light blue, yellow  arrows). These changes were recorded as a function of distance vs time using atomic-level computer simulation (with some  example data included top right) and verified using multiple experimental analyses.
