title: Turbulent flow generated by a fractal square grid in a virtual wind tunnel based on the flow solver Incompact3d using 8,100 computational cores
name: Dr Sylvain Laizet
institution: Imperial College London, Department of Aeronautics
description: Fractal grids, which are made from a structure, such as a square, repeated at different scales, can make very efficient mixers. They create high turbulence with little energy input and you only need to make very small changes to the grid to have an enormous effect. Such devices are an alternative to current static in-line mixers for fluid mixing and can be used for mixing a fluid and a gas to create homogenous end products. Target applications include the petrochemical industries for additive mixing; in waste and water treatment for aeration, sludge mixing and chemical addition as well as for generating powders in the pharmaceuticals industry.<br><br>Simulations of the turbulence created by fractal grids are allowing a better understanding of the mixing process and will allow the design of optimised energy-efficient mixers. They are a central component of our research and are constantly compared to our experimental results.
