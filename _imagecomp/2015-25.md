title:  A time-elapsed image of diffusion of tracer particles in a turbulent, electrically conducting fluid. 
name: Dr Jane Pratt, A. Busse and W.C.Mueller
institution: University of Exeter, Department of Physics
description:  In the solar wind or in a fusion machine, a varying magnetic field can create turbulence that behaves two-dimensional in certain ways.   We analyze this quasi-two-dimensionalization of turbulence from the Lagrangian perspective, based on direct numerical simulations of  incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The Lagrangian viewpoint follows the movement of tracer particles in an evolving flow,  and naturally produces information about turbulent diffusion and dispersion, and the formation of flow structures.  Our simulations  calculate statistics from 16 million tracer particles.  We find that diffusion and dispersion are strongly influenced by the presence  and direction of the magnetic field.
