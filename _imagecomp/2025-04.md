title: Root of Failure
description: 3D discrete element method (DEM) reveals grain size sculpting contacts, contacts braiding forces, and forces becoming strength. Granular materials fail or hold—by their network. Using 3D discrete-element simulations (MFIX-DEM) on the ARCHER2 supercomputer, we explore how the grain-size distribution (GSD) organizes the contact network that governs rheology. In each granular assembly, particles are coloured by diameter while the paired contact network (drawn as a graph of force chains) highlights strong and weak pathways. As the GSD shifts, so does the network’s connectivity, anisotropy and load-bearing architecture, altering effective friction and the onset of yield. These renderings (ParaView + OSPRay Path Tracer) make visible the “root of failure”&colon;  the percolation and collapse of strong chains within a sea of weaker links. From this platform we probe how the internal force network forecasts incipient failure in natural piles (landslides and other gravity-driven flows) and ask whether in situ or remote proxies for contact-network health could help assess slope strength before it gives way.
