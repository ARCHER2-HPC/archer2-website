title: Li promoters on &eta;-Mn3N2
name: Constantinos Zeinalipour-Yazdi
institution: University College London
description:  Understanding the mechanism of catalytic reactions is critical in the development of new catalyst formulations and process conditions that have lower energy requirements. In catalytic reactions the role  of  defects and promoters is currently not well understood at the atomistic  level. In this study we obtained a better understanding via dispersion-corrected DFT of the role of Li promoters in ammonia synthesis on &eta;-Mn3N2.
