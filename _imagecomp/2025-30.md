title: Deflected Wake of a Partially Trailing-Edge Flexible Aerofoil
description: This visual presents the flow field generated by a partially flexible aerofoil, exhibiting a distinctly asymmetrical deflected wake pattern caused by a symmetry-breaking bifurcation due to the coupled interaction between the trailing-edge flexible aerofoil and the incoming fluid flow. The numerical simulation is performed by coupling the fluid solver OpenFOAM (finite-volume method based) for the fluid dynamics with the structural solver CalcluliX (finite-element method based) for the structural dynamics using Archer2 HPC. From this wake, a vortex pair detaches, while a single isolated vortex is shed independently. The resulting fluid flow from the fluid-structure interaction highlights the influence of flexibility on the resulting wake and vortex dynamics, deviating from the rigid counterparts. Line integral convolution captures these unsteady flow features, tracing the streamlines, showcasing how imperfection can also be beautiful.
