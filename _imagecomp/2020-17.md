title: Symmetric and anti-symmetric bypass transition induced by plamsa actuation
name: Dandan Xiao
institution: Department of Engineering, University of Nottingham
description:  Bypass transition in a boundary layer flow induced by a pair of DBD plamsa actuators is presented. By varying the distance between the two actuators, two forms of instabilities and subsequently the scenarios of transition, namely a symmetric one and an anti-symmetric one, are observed from Direct Numerical Simulations (large figures). These are confirmed by non-modal studies revealing the transient dynamics of  perturbations leading to the onset of transition (small figures)
