title: This image shows vortex stuctures in the transition region on the suction-side surface of a transonic airfoil.

description: This image shows the transition region on the suction-side surface of an aircraft wing-section. Coherent vortices are identified by Q-criteria surfaces, which is a well established method in the field of computational fluid dynamics. The iso-surfaces are coloured by their local vorticity magnitude, where yellow suggests high vorticity, while light blue denotes lower vorticity levels. A rapid turbulent breakdown can be observed after near-wall streaks are stretched by big 2D vortex sturctures. The presented snapshot is taken from a 3D direct numerical simulation of an airfoil in a transonic free-stream at Mach 0.7, considering a Reynolds number of 500,000. The spanwise periodic domain extent is a quarter of the axial chord length resulting in a grid that consists of more than 5 billion cells. The simulation is carried out on ARCHER using more than 60,000 cores.
