title: Simulated convective storms in the Houston region
name: Bethan White
institution: Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, University of Oxford
description:  High-resolution simulations of isolated convective storms occurring over the Houston region, Texas. The image shows clouds (dark blue shaded volumes) and rain accumulated on the ground (blue-purple solid colour contour overlaid on the land surface). These simulations are performed as part of a study which investigates the impact of atmospheric aerosol pollution emitted in and around the city of the Houston on the intensity of the storms and rain which form in the region. The impact of aerosol pollution on convective clouds remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our understanding of the climate system. Studies which are able to resolve these processes in high resolution and over long timescales are therefore crucial in helping us to reduce this uncertainty and improve the confidence of our future climate projections.
