title: Flow and structure of the Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctica
name: Dr Martin O'Leary
institution: University of Swansea, Department of Geography
description:  The Larsen C ice shelf is an area of floating glacial ice in Antarctica, roughly two and a half times the size of Wales. A changing  climate has caused temperatures in this part of Antarctica to rise greatly over the past few decades, which has allowed meltwater to  seep into the ice, warming it and changing its material properties. Similar processes have already caused the collapse of the Larsen  A and B ice shelves. If Larsen C were to collapse, nearby glaciers would accelerate and thin, leading to a large contribution to sea level rise.<br /><br />This image illustrates the flow of ice in Larsen C, along with the stresses being generated by its motion. Using high-resolution numerical modelling on ARCHER, we are able to map these stresses, and predict the future evolution of the ice shelf.
