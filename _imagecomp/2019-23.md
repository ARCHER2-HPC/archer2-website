title: Jet fuel swirling spray flame near extinction
name: Jenna Foale
institution: University of Cambridge, Deptartment of Engineering
description:  This video shows a transient simulation of a petroleum kerosene spray flame that is close to being extinguished. The liquid spray, coloured with temperature (Kelvin), vaporizes from the heat of the combustion reaction zone, releasing fuel pyrolysis products which then burn near the swirling atmospheric temperature air from the annulus around the bluff body. The three-dimensional stoichiometric iso-surface of the flame is shown dancing above the bluff body, and is coloured with OH radical mass fraction. The black spots show lack of OH, and thus lack of chemical reaction, indicating local extinctions along the flame's surface. The iso-surface shrinks as the flame nears global extinction. The calculations were performed on Archer using OpenFOAM with the Combustion Moment Closure model.
