title: In-situ visualisation at scale applied to Large Eddy Simulations in a heat exchanger tube bundle. Four mesh sizes are considered, going from 7 million cells (top left) to 3,391 millions cells (bottom right).

description: High-fidelity turbulence simulations are performed in an elemental part of a heat exchanger tube bundle. The development of the flow is shown for 4 meshes of increasing size, each of the simulations being run using an optimal number of processors for the CFD software on ARCHER. The 4 animations that make the full video are obtained from frames generated on the fly by an in-situ visualisation library (catalyst) coupled with a solver (Code_Saturne). The largest simulation (bottom right animation) deals with an extremely large mesh of about 3.4 billion cells, and is run using about 90% of the full ARCHER (98,304 processors/4,096 nodes). The 151 generated frames  amount for about 50 megabytes of data. In comparison, traditional postprocessing relying on dumping data on disk would require about 4.5 terabytes of data, making them nearly impossible to be dealt with. ffmpeg is used to generate the final video.
