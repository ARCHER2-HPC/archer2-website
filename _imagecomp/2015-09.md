title: Flow visualisation of vesicle model
name: Dr Matthieu Chavent
institution: University of Oxford, SBCB Group, Department of Biochemistry
description: The cell membrane is a complex and crowded environment with different types of molecules such as lipids and proteins which are in a  dynamic equilibrium. To try to better understand this dynamic behaviour, it is possible to develop models mimicking this membrane. Animating  such models can be very challenging. We used calculations launched on ARCHER computer to see how the constituents of this membrane interact  together. Inspired by approaches in physics to depict wind or ocean currents we developed a new way to display collective movements of  lipids molecules constituting the <a href="http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/flows/">membrane model</a>. Visualization of the lipid flows in a protein  crowded systems. This allows to model the movement of lipids when the proteins are clustered together forming channels guiding the  flow of lipids. This extends previous model combining both experimental and theoretical results (goo.gl/1LAUmd). Rendering with  VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Gray&colon; membrane proteins. Red&colon; high-velocity flow; green&colon; low-velocity flow.
