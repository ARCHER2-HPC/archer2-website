title: Ice is born in vibrating nanopores
description: Ice nucleation in supercooled water begins when small molecular clusters organize into the first ice-like structures. The figure shows this process&colon; white molecules indicate ice (transparent particles) forming within supercooled water (blue particles) confined in a nanopore whose wall vibrates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that vibration induces negative pressure as the wall stretches the confined liquid. This tension promotes the growth of larger ice-like clusters, thereby accelerating nucleation. Once these clusters reach a critical size, they coalesce into a stable front that propagates swiftly across the nanopore, transforming the entire volume into ice. All simulations were conducted in LAMMPS on the ARCHER2.
