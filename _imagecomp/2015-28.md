title: Music, order and chaos in a combustion chamber
name: Mr Ivan Langella
institution: University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering
description: This picture shows the flow inside a gas turbine combustion chamber computed using ARCHER. The swirling flow enters the  chamber from the left as indicated by the arrows and evolves to become chaotic in the early part of the chamber, where vortical  structures, colored by temperature, can be observed. A trumpet-like iso-pressure surface surrounded by this chaos is produced by  the flow accelerating towards the exit because of the interaction between flame and turbulence. One can see order emerging from the  chaos resulting in a beautiful flow structure. Understanding this interaction helps to construct "silent" combustors for future  environmentally friendly gas turbine engines. <br /><br /> Colors represent temperature (red - high, blue - low) for vortical structures and velocity vectors, and vorticity on the iso-pressure surfaces.
