description:  The developing of novel nanocarriers for drug delivery could help to overcome the current limitation of traditional medicines with potential social and economic impacts. Polymeric micelles, such as the versatile polyether-based block copolymers, are promising nanocarrier that can improve the transport of otherwise easily degradable therapeutic proteins in the human body.  However, despite a large number of experimental studies, detailed molecular descriptions of absorption and release processes of proteins by this type of micelles are still very limited.  Molecular modeling is a powerful tool to obtain detailed molecular insights into these phenomena that can help to improve the design of these nanocarriers. The image shows the protein lysozyme embraced by the protruding Pluronic P85 chains of a small micelle. The image was the result of Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) exploration lasted 400 ns and carried out with the class Gromacs2016  nano-submarine MDS Nautilus powered by the ARCHER engine.
