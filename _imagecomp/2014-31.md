description:  Silicon dioxide is widely used for various technological applications. In particular, it is an integral component of the transistors that make up computer processors. Over the years, advances in engineering have reduced the size of transistors into the nano-scale which has exacerbated a number of transistor reliability issues. In addition, the average processor now typically undergoes more than 400 fabrication processes and is soaked in hydrogen after every fabrication step. Although silicon dioxide has been intensively studied for over five decades, its interaction with hydrogen still remains controversial, with the common perception being that hydrogen acts as a benign entity. Our state of the art calculations on the Archer supercomputer find that hydrogen can create defective sites in silicon dioxide, such as that depicted in the image. This interaction has implications for our transistor fabrication processes in addition to playing a role in some transistor device reliability issues.
