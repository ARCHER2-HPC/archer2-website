title: Eppur si muove. Computational simulations unravel hidden protein dynamics.

description:  Proteins play a huge diversity of functions in cells and most of nowadays medicines work because they correct abnormal behaviors of proteins. In the particular case of Cyclophilin A, its malfunctions are linked to variety of illness ranging from autoimmune diseases to cancer. In order to develop a new generation of medicines able to correct such abnormal behaviors of Cyclophilin A we need an accurate description of its "hidden dynamics". This term describes the set of movements that are known to occur on a protein, but are very difficult to describe using experimental techniques because they happen rarely. Nevertheless, the combination of molecular dynamic simulation obtained in ARCHER with new data analysis techniques have allowed us to develop a model of the hidden dynamics of Cyclophilin A with atomic detail. This picture was obtained using VMD software and illustrates movements on the Cyclophilin A protein as predicted by our model.
