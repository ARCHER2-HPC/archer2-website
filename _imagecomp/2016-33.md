title: When turbulence meets a vanishing sound speed
name: Dr. Emile Touber
institution: Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London
description:  The picture is a snapshot of two-dimensional turbulence in the vicinity of the liquid-vapour critical point, where the speed of sound is nearly brought to a halt (red regions). Slowing down the speed of sound to such extremes gives birth to a wide range of non-linear wave phenomena not observed in ideal substances. These waves generate vast amounts of vortical structures (shown in black and white), which then significantly alter the way turbulence redistributes the kinetic energy across scales (the so-called energy cascade). These findings suggest that real-gas thermodynamics could offer a novel way of controlling turbulence (i.e. other than through boundary conditions or body forces), with possible applications in future energy production devices exploiting the properties of the liquid-vapour critical point. Capturing the kinetic energy redistribution process across scales requires significant computational resources such as Archer.
