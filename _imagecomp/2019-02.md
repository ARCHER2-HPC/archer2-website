title: Electron localization function (ELF) 001 cuts through hot dense liquid lithium.
name: Victor Naden Robinson
institution: The University of Edniburgh, Physics and Astronomy
description:  100 cuts through high pressure and temperature liquid lithium showing the electron localization function (ELF) isosurface from 0.0 (blue) to 1.0 (red). Off site charge density appears to localize between atoms with no nuclei in their centre.
