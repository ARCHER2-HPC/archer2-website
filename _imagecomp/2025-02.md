title: Radiation-Hydrodynamics simulation of burning inertial fusion design
description: This image shows a simulation of an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosion. ICF experiments involve firing an external driver (generally a laser) at a capsule which contains fusion fuel. The capsule then implodes, creating extreme temperatures and densities and leading to a high rate of fusion. The physics of ICF is well captured by radiation-hydrodynamics simulation. Shown in the image are the electron temperature and mass density at the time of peak fusion rate, this multi-dimensional simulation includes the effect of fusion product heating of the fuel. The simulation was the end product of a machine learning driven optimisation of implosion design. Archer2 was used to perform hundreds of two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, enabling autonomous design in order to maximise the fusion energy released.
