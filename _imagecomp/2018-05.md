title: Spherical nanoparticles in an asymmetrical diblock copolymer
name:  Javier Diaz
institution: University of Lincoln, School of Mathematics and Physics
description: Spherical nanoparticles (red) are dispersed in a diblock copolymer mixture. In the absence of particles, a diblock copolymer can phase separate into ordered alternating phases with a periodicity. This makes copolymers a perfect matrix to assembly colloid. Here, the red colloids have an affinity towards the interior of the domains.
