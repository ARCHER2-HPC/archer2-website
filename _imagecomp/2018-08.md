title: Protein clustering on a neuron surface
name: William Glass
institution: University of Oxford, Department of Biochemistry
description: In order for excitable cells to function correctly certain proteins (called ion channels) are critical to allow charged ions to pass across the membrane. The image shows a certain type of ion channel (a voltage-gated sodium channel, blue) that has recently been shown to cluster with other proteins called beta 3 subunits (shown in green). Although it has been shown previously that these proteins interact we have yet to have a clear picture of just what this interaction is and how it can affect the density, location and function of the ion channel. In order to investigate this computationally we used large scale coarse-grained simulations (where 4 'heavy' atoms are represented by 1 'bead'). We constructed a membrane using lipids that are typically found in mammalian cells, with 9 copies of the ion channel and 36 copies of the smaller beta 3 subunit. This system was run for 20 microseconds.
