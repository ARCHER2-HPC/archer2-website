title: Deep Impact&colon; What Grain Do In The Shadows
description: We illustrates a 3D discrete element method (DEM) simulation performed with the MFIX-DEM solver on the ARCHER2 high-performance computing facility and visualized in ParaView with the OSPRay path tracer, capturing the fleeting complexity of transient granular flow. A single impactor, ten times larger than the background grains, strikes a bed of 1.1 million particles at 100 m/s.<br><br>On the left, particles are coloured by velocity, revealing a granular shockwave that ripples radially through the assembly, compressing and dilating the mixture as it dissipates into the medium. On the right, a slice through the bed center exposes the evolving contact network, the hidden skeleton of force, where braided chains of compression and fragile links of tension form, buckle, and fade.<br><br>Much of this intricate choreography remains invisible in nature, yet simulations like this allow us to unravel the hidden architectures behind the intrinsic complexity of granular matter, where strength and failure are born from the synergy of weak and strong force chains.
