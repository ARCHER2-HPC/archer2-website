title: Laser wakefield acceleration of an externally injected electron beam.
name: Dr Elisabetta Boella
institution: Lancaster University, Physics Department
description:  As a boat travelling in the sea excites in its wake a trail of waves, so does an intense laser when shone into a tenuous plasma. As a surfer can catch these waves and ride them, so do electrons, which in this way get accelerated to high energies. The picture shows the wave (blue) excited by a terawatt laser (colour) propagating through a plasma. An electron beam (witness bunch, red) has been externally injected into the wake. The witness beam is successfully trapped and further accelerated. The simulation, performed with the Particle-In-Cell code OSIRIS on ARCHER, uses laser and beam conditions available at the Cockcroft Institute (Daresbury Laboratory). This work is preparatory to experiments aiming to demonstrate high-quality electrons from laser wakefield via external injection.
