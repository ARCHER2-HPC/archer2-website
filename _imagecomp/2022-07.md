title: Simulation of 3D calving dynamics at Jakobshavn Isbrae
name: Iain Wheel
institution: University of St Andrews, School of Geography and Sustainable Development
description: Calving is the breaking off of icebergs at the front of tidewater glaciers (those that flow into the sea). It accounts for around half of the ice mass loss from Greenland so is extremely important in the context of sea level rise. Of particular interest is Greenland's largest glacier, Jakobshavn Isbrae, which accounts for a fifth of the mass loss from the whole ice sheet. Using the open source finite element model, Elmer/Ice and a novel 3D calving algorithm, the video shows the evolution of the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbrae over 100 days of summer 2017.
