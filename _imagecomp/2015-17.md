title: Inflation of a porous organic cage.
name: Ms Valentina Santolini
institution: Imperial College London
description:  Porous organic cages are defined as a collection of molecules assembled in the shape of a cage. They are characterised by the  presence of a cavity which is able to host smaller molecules. In recent work we tried to simulate the scaffolding effect of  solvent (symbolically represented by the yellow sphere inside the cages on the right end side) within porous organic cages. On the  left hand side of the image we show an example cage before we simulate the effect of the solvent. There, the cage is in its "collapsed"  state, as it lacks the internal cavity. The collapsed state can methaphorically resemble a deflated balloon. Solvent molecules act as a  scaffold opening up the structure. This leads to the "balloon" inflating when physical effects due to the solvent are included in the simulations.
