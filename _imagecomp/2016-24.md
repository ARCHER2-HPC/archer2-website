title: Wee Archie - The Suitcase-sized Supercomputer  
name: Dr. Lorna Smith
institution: EPCC, University of Edinburgh 
description:  Wee Archie is a suitcase-sized supercomputer, designed to let school children try their hand at computing and learn about the benefits of supercomputing. The system has been created to be representative of the system design in massively parallel architectures. There are 18 Raspberry Pi's, each acting as a multi-core node providing a total of 72 cores and 144GB of RAM, a network switch, a power supply unit (PSU) and Ethernet cables. Each Raspberry Pi has an LED display that lights up when in use, providing a visual display that helps demonstrate how multiple processors work in parallel to solve complex tasks. We have a suite of demos for Wee Archie. These demos highlight real science from the ARCHER system and show the benefits of ARCHER in a fun and accessible manner.<br />			 Wee Archie was designed and built through a collaboration between EPCC and Edinburgh University's science outreach group, FUSION.
