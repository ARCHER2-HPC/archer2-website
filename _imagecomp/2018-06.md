title: Circular nanoparticles segregating to the interface between lamellar diblock copolymer domains. 
name:  Javier Diaz
institution: University of Lincoln, School of Mathematics and Physics
description:  Colloidal nanoparticles can be mixed with diblock copolymers to produce highly ordered polymer nanocomposite materials. This video shows a simulation of a low concentration of colloids that segregate to the interface between a symmetrical lamella-forming diblock copolymer. The result of this co-assembly is a system with highly localized colloids.
