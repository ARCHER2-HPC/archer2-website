title: Exploring an Exploding Nanodroplet
description: Droplet explosion, which fragments the droplet into several secondary droplets, is generally considered to improve the homogeneity of atom distribution and benefit the atomization process. However, the underlying physics within the droplet, represented in grey in this image, remains unclear. Through reactive molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS on ARCHER2, we uncovered the explosion mechanism of a nanometer-sized metal-containing  droplet at the atomistic scale. This image illustrates the reaction pathways of molecular cluster, along with cluster analysis and energy profiles of the nanodroplet. This image was generated using Ovitio post-processing software.
