title: Ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation
name: Hector Martinez-Navarro
institution: Computational Cardiovascular Science group, University of Oxford
description:  This video has been rendered based on the results obtained from a highly-detailed computer simulation of human cardiac electrophysiology. We used a torso/heart tridimensional multiscale model created from computer tomography scan images. It includes realistic cell membrane kinetics and has been validated against clinical data.<br /> For this simulation, we modelled coronary occlusion leading to ischemia in certain region of the myocardial tissue. Three regular beats were simulated and then a premature stimulus was induced triggering a re-entrant wave which leaded to ventricular fibrillation.<br />		The use of computer models for medical science offers a very powerful alternative experimental data is not available due to technical or ethical limitations. Our aim is to provide risk assessment for ischemic patients and investigate drug safety and efficacy under these circumstances using High Performance Computing.
