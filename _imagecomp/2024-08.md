title: Leading-edge vortex instability over a plunging swept wing
description: The image shows the flow field over a plunging swept wing and the vortices that are formed due to the motion. The colouring is by normalised velocity magnitude. Instabilities are present where the leading-edge vortex is attached to the wing surface, which cause the characterstic shape of the vortex. Other features include the tip vortex and the trailing-edge vortex.<br>This research focusses on investigating the unstable nature of these vortices over swept wing geometries and how this affects lift produced by small fliers, known as micro-air vehicles. To provide context, the wing shown has a physical size of 0.24m wing span and 0.08m chord length.
