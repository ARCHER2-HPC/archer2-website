title: Snapshot of the simulated cardiac electrical activity for a personalized model from a 65 years old man MRI. Left panel, the electrical potential at the epicardical surface (potential values go from blue to red). Central panel, isopotential lines of the body surface and the electrode potitions (blue markers). Right panel, the resulting simulated electrocardiogram derived from the electrodes.

description: We present a fully automatic pipeline from the clinical magnetic resonance images to the simulation of the electrocardiogram (ECG). These personalised 3D finite element models of the geometry of the torso and heart together with a detailed electrophysiological model at cellular level allow us to virtually simulate the electrical activity of the heart. The ECG, which is the most important non invasive diagnostic tool in the clinic, records the electrical activity of the heart at different torso locations. The high complexity of these models as well as the different scales involved make the whole pipeline a challenge in terms of computational resources. The use of Archer and its parallelisation facilities allows us to simulate one heart beat in 2 hours in 960 processors on a ~50 million element mesh. These simulations improve the capability of the ECG as a patient-specific diagnostic tool.
