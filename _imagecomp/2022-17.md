title: Axial velocity contours showing wakes from stator and rotor blades of a DLR research compressor
name: Dr Arun Prabhakar
institution: University of Warwick, Department of Computer Science
description: The visualization is produced from a simulation of a research compressor, RIG250 from the German Aerospace Centre(DLR), using a mesh consisting of 4.58 billion elements. It shows the axial velocity contours that illustrate the wakes forming from the stator and rotor blades of the compressor. The snapshot is taken at a physical time equivalent to 1 revolution of the compressor. Rolls-Royce's in house production CFD solver, Hydra, is used to solve the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The flow in the domain is highly turbulent and is predicted using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with wall functions. In situ visualization is carried out using Rolls-Royce's SS02 code, based on ParaView. This large scale simulation denotes a step towards virtual certification of gas turbine engines.
