title: Instantaneous spatial structure of elastic turbulence at vanishing Reynolds number and large Weissenberg number
description: Viscoelastic fluids like dilute polymer solutions belong to the unexplored class of non-Newtonian fluids & exhibit chaotic motion at vanishing Reynolds numbers (often called elastic turbulence), which is in stark contrast to their Newtonian counterpart. We have created the first-ever 3D simulations of viscoelastic fluids using up to 32,000 CPU cores on ARCHER2. Those simulations provide an additional pillar next to experiment and theory to elucidate the exiting but unexplored unsteady state dynamics of viscoelastic fluids. For example, the simulations have provided evidence for chaotic motion of viscoelastic fluids being organised by exact coherent states, a theoretical concept that helped to understand the Newtonian counterpart. The figure presents simulation data by showing instantaneous vertical slices of the normalised polymer elongation at several positions in the 3D volume.
