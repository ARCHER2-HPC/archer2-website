title: Colourful Caustics

description:  High harmonic generation (HHG) is the fundamental process of attosecond science. It enables us to  convert low energy driving laser pulses into high-energy, ultrashort bursts of light.<br /> The image shows the harmonic spectra of a neon atom irradiated by two time-delayed laser pulses. The  striking red "mountains" in the foreground of the image are spectral caustics. Most people are familiar with  optical caustics - the curves of light at the bottom of a tea cup or the bright spots of focused light  on the floor of a swimming pool. In HHG, caustics result from the coalescence of more than two electron  trajectories in the same spectral region, which can be engineered by adding a second colour to the driving laser pulse.<br /> The harmonic spectra calculations were performed on ARCHER using the RMT code, which has been developed  at Queen's University Belfast to model the correlated dynamics of many-electron systems.
