title: Artistic representation of a proposed one-direction walking molecule on a metallic surface.
name: Dr David Abbasi P&eacute;rez
institution: King's College London, Department of Physics
description:  We are looking for molecules which tend to move on a surface towards one direction rather than to the opposite one. This is a  property related to molecular machines. In order to achieve this we need to understand how molecules walk on the surface, computing  their geometries, and the energy barriers the molecules have to overcome to get their new position. This is a very high-demanding  computational task, and is where ARCHER plays its important role, allowing us to access to all that information by means of its very  high computational power. The image is an artistic representation of one of these molecules moving along the surface, and was created  using open-source codes like Jmol, Blender and The Gimp.
