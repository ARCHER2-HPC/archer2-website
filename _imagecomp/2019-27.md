title: Seismic Waves in the Ocean
name: Mr Benjamin Fernando
institution: Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford 
description: Seismology - the study of earthquakes and the ground-shaking waves they produce - allows us to explore the interior of our planet, revealing details of its structure and behaviour which are otherwise hidden. One challenge, however, is understanding how the oceans affect the seismic waves which we observe and measure. <br> To investigate this effect, we build computer models of what we think the vibrations produced by a given earthquake should look like. This video shows such a prediction, from an earthquake in New Guinea. This is the first global-scale seismic simulation with a realistic ocean that we are aware of, and hence it represents an important step forward in seismic modelling. <br>We record the predicted wave energies on the seafloor, revealing a detailed and complex pattern which we can then compare to observations to learn more about the Earth's interior structure and the processes at work deep beneath the ground.
