title: Fine-scale numerical system for prediction nearshore upwelling in Canaria Basin and carbon removal, 3D animation of temperature distribution 
name: Dr Dmitry Aleynik and Dr Max Holloway
institution: SAMS
description: The coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation model of the Canary Current Upwelling System predicts the timing and position of filaments and stripes of colder seawater enriched with higher levels of dissolved nutrients over five days.  The intake seawater pipes are feeding a prototype novel sustainable protein farm located in a desert area near the coast.  An unstructured Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model with unprecedented resolution (100m) allows assessment of the dispersion of de-acidified water discharged from shallow basins, where dissolved carbon dioxide is naturally consumed by growing microalgae. The ponds are the size of a football pitch, expected to scale up to 1000ha. Physical oceanographic measurements over different seasons helped to calibrate and then evaluate the accuracy of model predictions. Development of the weather (WRF) and ocean (FVCOM) components of the regional hydrodynamic modelling system, test runs on ARCHER2 HPC and visualization (cooperation with M.Holloway) were supported by Innovate-UK (Agri-SATT grant) and NERC.
