title: Vortex Shedding Induced by Multiple Covert-Inspired Flaps
description: This image shows an aerofoil at a post-stall angle of attack, equipped with avian covert feathers-inspired multiple flexible flaps. These flaps passively interact with the surrounding unsteady flow, promoting the formation and interaction with complex vortices in the wake, including leading-edge influencing lift enhancement and stall delay which is particularly crucial at high angles of attack.  The underlying two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction is shown, in which aerodynamic forces drive flap deformation, while the resulting structural response alters the flow field. The numerical simulation is performed by coupling the finite-volume method-based solver OpenFOAM for the fluid dynamics with the fine-element method-based solver CalcluliX for the structural dynamics, conducted on Archer2 HPC. The visualisation presented employed line integral convolution, which highlights the streamlines, revealing the intricate vortices present and offering deeper insight into the underlying method of flow control.
