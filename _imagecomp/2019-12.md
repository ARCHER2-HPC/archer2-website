title: Interaction between bubbles and turbulence in pool boiling system
name: Linlin Fei and Kai H. Luo
institution: Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London
description:  This image shows 3D high-resolution direct numerical simulations of pool boiling process using an advanced cascaded Lattice Boltzmann method. The bubbles are in green and the high temperature regions are marked in red color. Multi-scale phenomena and turbulence fluctuations can be clearly seen from perspectives of the bubble size distributions and the bubble location distributions, respectively. The high-temperature regions dragged by the rising bubbles indicate the enhanced heat-transfer due to the existence of phase-change.
