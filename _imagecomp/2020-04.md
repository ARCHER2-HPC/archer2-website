title: Tip leakage loss generation in an axial compressor stator blade.
name: Joshua Maynard
institution: University of Cambridge, Engineering
description:  The flow in an axial compressor that escapes through the clearance between the blade and rotating hub is known as the tip leakage flow. This video shows a radial and axial cut demonstrating the unsteady, turbulent nature of tip leakage flow in an axial compressor stator blade. Tip leakage flow accounts for up to 30% of loss in axial compressors. Loss which contributes to increased gas turbine fuel burn and therefore large environmental impact and cost, as gas turbines generate roughly 45% of UK energy. Entropy function is analogous to local lost work and dark blue areas, such as the flapping open separation in the tip gap, are high in loss. High fidelity computational fluid dynamics is a critical tool for building understanding of the flow behaviour as the complex phenomena are outside the scope of standard computational methods and geometric constraints make experimental measurements difficult.
