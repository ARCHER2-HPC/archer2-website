title: Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow past a vertical plate in a transitional phase
name: Prof. Jae-Wook Kim
institution: University of Southampton / Aeronautics & Astronautics
description: Iso-contours of spanwise vorticity showing the first vortex shedding (due to the instability of a recirculation bubble) and the development of the periodic shedding modes in the initial stage of flow past a vertical plate. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) using Compressible Aerodynamics & Aeroacoustics Research coDe (CANARD) at Re=2,000 and M=0.25.
