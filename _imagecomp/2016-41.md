title: 2D photo-electron momentum distribution after ionisation of hydrogen molecular ion with IR fields.
name: Mr. Alejandro de la Calle
institution: Atomistic Simulation Centre, School of Mathematics and Physics. Queen's University Belfast
description:  Momentum distribution of ionised electron from hydrogen molecular ion after interaction with an ultra-intense infrared laser pulse. The circular structures with their centres along the central axis are due to rescattering of the electron against one of the two parent nucleus. The energy that the electron has gained from the field after ionisation allows for probing the structure and dynamics of the parent system. For example, electron emission in a diatomic molecule as the hydrogen molecular ion presents two-center interference, the same kind of intereference present in a double-slit experiment. The data was obtained solving the time-dependent Schrï¿½dinger equation on a massively parallel calculation on the ARCHER supercomputer.
