title: The Many Faces of Heterogeneous Ice Nucleation Unmasked By Computer Simulations
name: Martin Fitzner
institution: Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London 
description:  This video shows heterogeneous ice nucleation - a phenomenon governing numerous processes ranging from cloud formation to cell-freezing in cryobiology - happening at the molecular scale. It is most challenging to obtain such insight from experiments, thus our computer simulations provide a molecule's eye view of the process where liquid water (red spheres) freezes into ice (blue spheres and bonds). We show that this process happens not in the liquid itself but rather at an interface with a foreign material (gray spheres). We studied the influence of the properties of the material that is in contact with the water and find a staggering sensitivity on its atomistic structure where even tiny changes lead to different freezing rates and ice structures ("crystal faces") forming on top of the surface. Our findings contribute to the effort aimed at one day being able to design materials that facilitate or avoid the formation of ice.
