title: Stereoscopic visualisation of vortex structures showing Q-criterion surfaces coloured by vorticity. Strong pressure gradients are indicated by black regions.
name:  Dr Markus Zauner
institution: University of Southampton, AFM Group
description:  Laminar-flow profiles aim to maintain laminar boundary layers for a large part of the airfoil to increase the aerodynamic performance of next-generation aircraft wings. At typical speeds of modern airplanes around 85% of the speed of sound, supersonic regions occur over wings. It is of great interest to study the interaction of shock waves with the wall-bounded flow, as this can lead to severe flow separation or undesirable phenomena like wing buffeting.<br>Direct numerical simulations were carried out using more than five billion grid points resolving even small turbulent structures. The image above shows the turbulent wake of a wing section at a Reynolds number of half a million, where black regions indicate strong pressure gradients across shock waves or acoustic waves. Stereoscopic visualisations give a great impression of three-dimensional vortex structures using simple red/blue 3D glasses.
