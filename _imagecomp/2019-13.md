title: Non-continuum gas flow in tight sandstone
name: Dr Lianhua Zhu
institution: Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Strathclyde
description:  Gas flows in the tight sandstone and shale are non-continuum in nature. The conventional pore-scale computational fluid dynamics methods fail to describe such flows and we need resort to a statistic description, by tracking the probabilities of finding a gas molecular flying with a specific velocity at a specific location. Because there are so many possible velocities and locations, we need a supercomputer like ARCHER to solve the underling equation. This image shows the one of the simulation results obtained with a massively parallel simulator we developed and optimized on ARCHER. With over 20,000 CPU cores, the simulator took only 5 minutes on ARCHER to get the solution.
