description:  Acute ischemia is a major cause of sudden cardiac death further promoted by antiarrhythmic drugs based on potassium blockers. In order to understand the mechanisms of arrhythmia under these conditions, a human ventricular detailed model is constructed by integrating experimental and electrophysiological data. Simulations were run in Chaste on Archer using a human finite element mesh of 14 million elements. The use of Archer and its parallelisation facilities allows us to simulate the very complex and computationally demanding abnormal electrical propagation or arrhythmia. <br>These simulations allow the investigation of different antiarrhythmic drugs and drug doses to identify arrhythmic risk.
