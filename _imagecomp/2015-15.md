title: Delayed detached-eddy simulation of a large civil aircraft in transonic flow
name: Dr Sebastian Timme
institution: University of Liverpool, Department of Engineering
description:  The image illustrates the phenomenon of shock buffet in the transonic flow around a large civil aircraft. The surface  pressure distribution highlights the strong shock wave forming over the wings, acting to separate the boundary layer and  resulting in large-scale turbulent eddies. Streamlines indicate the disturbed airflow in the wake behind the wings.<br /><br />Understanding shock buffet is important in aircraft design as the resulting structural vibrations and unsteady aerodynamic loads limit the flight envelop. The data shown in the figure is the result of six coupled nonlinear equations solved at 29 million points for over 100,000 time steps. This enormous computational task would not have been possible without access to ARCHER through the EPSRC Resource Allocation Panel.
