title: Primary hairpin vortex structure in a turbulent-to-turbulent transition of flow in a channel with a 3-D roughness.
name: Dr Mehdi Seddighi
institution: University of Sheffield Department of Mechanical Engineering
description:  Unsteady flows, in which the bulk velocity of a wall-bounded flow or the free-stream velocity of a boundary-layer flow vary with time, are encountered in many engineering applications. DNS has been used to investigate the transient behaviour of turbulence following a rapid flow acceleration from an initially turbulent flow in a channel with a smooth top wall and a roughened bottom wall made of close-packed pyramids. The image shows the shape of the head-up hairpin structures (in red colour) observed during the early transient stages which is similar to that of the primary hairpin structures observed for steady smooth wall flow, contrasting with the U-shape head-down vortices observed for steady fully-rough channel flows with similar pyramid roughness. The vortex is visualised using Q-criterion. The blue structures exhibit the iso-surface of the pressure.
