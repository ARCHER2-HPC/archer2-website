title: Electric field generated by the heart in the human body at the beginning of a heartbeat in healthy (left) and diseased (right) conditions.
name: Dr Alfonso Bueno Orovio
institution: Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford
description:  The figure shows the electric field generated by the heart in the human body during the initiation of a heartbeat. This is shown for a healthy person (left) and for a person with the diseased condition known as right bundle branch block (right), where your right ventricle is not able to activate properly. In the heart, the red colour indicates the areas that have been electrically activated, while those in blue are areas yet to be excited. In the body, the streamlines show the electric field produced by such an electrical activity, coloured by electric voltage potential. This can be measured for diagnosis in the clinic in the form of an electrocardiogram. The use of ARCHER has allowed the investigation of multiple disease conditions in the human heart, to augment information that has been obtained from these signals for a better diagnosis of patients, and to improve their tailoring of therapy.
