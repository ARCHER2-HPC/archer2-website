title: A beam of high-energy electrons created in a ultra-high-intensity laser-plasma interaction focuses within the gold target
name: Dr Robbie Scott
institution: STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Central Laser Facility
description:  Ultra-high-intensity lasers generate beams of high-energy electrons when they are fired at solid targets. In principal these electron beams can be used to initiate controlled thermonuclear fusion within the laboratory - a near infinite source of clean, green, energy. Previously the electron beam has been found to be highly divergent, meaning it is very inefficient at initiating fusion. Using the EPOCH code running on ARCHER, a new scheme has been investigated which has been shown to produce a beam of high-energy electrons instead focus within the target, potentially greatly improving the efficiency of the fusion scheme.
