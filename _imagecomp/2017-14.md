title: ARCHER's Numerical Wind Tunnel
name: Luke Masini
institution: School of Engineering, University of Liverpool
description:  The image shows the fusion of experimental and numerical wind tunnel data of an aircraft wing revealing complex flow features in high-speed flight. The wing surface is coloured by the instantaneous static pressure, with a sharp colour change highlighting a shock wave discontinuity. Such pressure jumps force the flow to detach from the wing surface generating large-scale turbulent eddies in the wake. Supercritical conditions result in shock wave unsteadiness and consequent fluctuating air loads requiring aircraft designers to incorporate measures of safety. These time-accurate simulations require extensive computational resources and were only made possible with ARCHER. The data will drive research into high-speed flow instability which will ultimately help to inform future wing design. <br />		The image of the Aircraft Research Association transonic wind tunnel was taken using a Nikon D5000 camera and the numerical data was superimposed in Tecplot.
