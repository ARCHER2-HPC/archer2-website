title: Turbulence-resolving simulation of the wake behind two in-line wind turbines
name: Georgios Deskos
institution: Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London
description:  Vortical structures generated in the wake of two in-line wind turbines with an incoming velocity of 10 m/s. The simulation was performed on ARCHER using the high-order finite-difference flow framework Winc3d/Incompact3d. The wind turbines are modelled using an actuator line model. Photos are not enhanced.
