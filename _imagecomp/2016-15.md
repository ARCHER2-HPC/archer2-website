title: Nested maps of historic mean annual maximum wave height
name: Dr Lucy Bricheno
institution: Marine Systems Modelling, National Oceanography Cente
description:  A nested modelling approach has been used to make projections of wave climate around North West Europe. A global  model at 0.83&deg; resolution for the whole globe, and an inner 'nest' of higher resolution (around 12km). The coastline  and features of the wave field are captured more sharply in the finer of the two model nests.<br /> This map shows a mean annual maximum significant wave height over a 30 year period from 1970 to 1999. The largest  surface waves are seen to the west / north-west of the British Isles, and can exceed 8m in height. Semi-enclosed seas,  such as the Irish Sea are more sheltered, with smaller maximum waves, averaging  2m in height over the thirty year period.
