title: Vortical Lines evolving in a turbulent jet flow from a round nozzle 
name: Mr Vassilis Ioannou
institution: Aeronautics, Imperial College London
description:  Evolution of a turbulent high-speed air jet ejected from a round nozzle in slow-moving air. The flow near the  nozzle-exit is based on large-scale annular structures whereas the flow further downstream is highly turbulent  with structures over a wide range of scales.<br /> The turbulent jet is a canonical flow representative of many practical applications such as, e.g., propulsion  jets of aircraft engines, hazardous toxic gases released from smokestacks, wastewater discharge from pipes into  rivers. Our aim is to manipulate the flow structures at the exit of the nozzle in order to achieve noise mitigation  and mixing enhancement.<br /> The data were produced by a high-fidelity simulation for which the equations describing the fluid motions were  solved with the open-source flow solver Incompact3d (www.incompact3d.com). The simulation was performed on the  UK national high performance computing facility ARCHER in a domain using more than 800 million nodes on 8,192 cores.
