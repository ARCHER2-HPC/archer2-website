title: Vibration-induced freeze desalination
description: Freeze desalination works by freezing seawater so that pure ice can be separated from the salty solution. The accompanying video illustrates this process at the molecular scale. White regions show ice forming and expanding within salt water, while green and yellow particles represent salt ions. As the ice front grows, these ions are rejected and pushed into the boundaries between ice grains, leaving behind purer ice. In this study, vibrational disturbances were applied to the system, which promoted ice nucleation and accelerated growth. The simulation captures how freezing and salt rejection occur simultaneously until the ice fills the entire domain. This work was performed using molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS on ARCHER2.
