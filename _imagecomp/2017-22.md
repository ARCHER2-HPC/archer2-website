title: Ultrafast magnetic droplet formation caused by laser heating of an amorphous GdFe thin film. The colouring indicates the perpendicular orientation of the magnetization.
name: Richard Evans
institution: Department of Physics, University of York
description:  Ultrafast laser excitation causes a range of complex effects in magnetic materials. In GdFe alloys the heat from a laser pulse can cause spontaneous switching of the magnetization direction due to the complex dynamics of Fe and Gd spins in the material. Here, we have simulated the response of a micrometre sized GdFe thin film to a 50 fs laser pulse using atomistic spin dynamics. In amorphous GdFe thin films a local variation of the composition has a strong effect on the probability of switching which we aim to understand. The movie shows the switching process for the film simulated on 12,288 cores of ARCHER, with a large number of magnetic droplets forming and then coalescing to form a complex random magnetic domain pattern after the pulse. The simulations show that the rate of expansion of the magnetic droplets is over 5 km/s representing one of the fastest processes in magnet materials.
