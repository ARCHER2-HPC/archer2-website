title: Wake Dynamics of Bio-Inspired Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Rotors
description: This video shows the wake dynamics of bioinspired vertical-axis wind turbine rotors by carrying out three-dimensional numerical simulations at a Reynolds number in the order of 104. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework is employed, utilising a sliding meshing technique with the Arbitrary Mesh Interface boundary condition. In the current simulation setup, we assign rotational motion to an inner rotating region comprising the turbine geometry, while the outer region of the domain remains stationary. The simulation was carried out using the finite volume Navier-Stokes solver within OpenFOAM on the ARCHER2 HPC system. Workload distribution via the scotch domain decomposition method enabled efficient use of large numbers of CPUs, reducing the extensive computational cost.  The bioinspired turbines are ideal for urban use&colon; they start easily in low winds and perform consistently across a broad range of wind conditions, surpassing conventional designs in peak output conditions.
