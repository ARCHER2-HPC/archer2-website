title: The emergence and coexistence of small-scale turbulence in an anisotropic and inhomogeneous flow
name: Mr Juan Carlos Bilbao Ludena
institution: Aeronautics Department - Imperial College London
description:   Enstrophy has a direct connection with the vortex stretching process that takes part during the energy cascade process and where dissipation finally occurs in turbulent flows. This quantity has been investigated mainly in Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence flows. The two pictures represent the spatial topological evolution of the transport of fluctuating enstrophy by turbulent fluctuations (pink contour with a value of 650) immersed around the largest scales possible in the present anisotropic flow (represented by the Q-criterion value of 2) and enables to see exactly how this quantity emergence right after transition occurs and also its short-lived but intense interaction. This simulation has been achieved employing Archer2 and this has enabled us to achieve the required small-scale resolution needed for accuracy. The new knowledge about this quantity will enable us to improve turbulence modeling particularly in complicated geometry settings and thus accelerate industrial processes.
