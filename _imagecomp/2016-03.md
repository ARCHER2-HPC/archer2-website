title: Photo-excitation dynamics in organic solar cells.
name: Dr Elton Santos and Mr. Peter Rice
institution: Queen's University Belfast
description:  Theoretical simulations using excited-state first-principles methods reveal that covalent functionalization and  the relative orientation of donor and acceptor units in heterointerfaces are critical parameters for electron-hole  dynamics.  Long believed but barely shown microscopically in real-time, the device geometry affects the polarization  of the interface, generating local electric fields that dissociate excitons harder or easier on a time scale of tenth  of femtoseconds.  This ultrafast charge transfer will help to understand how organic photovoltaic devices work in  real-life applications, e.g. generation of electricity.
