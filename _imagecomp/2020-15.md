title: Plasmoids in magnetic reconnection&colon; evolving towards bigger size
name: Elisabetta Boella
institution: Physics Department, Lancaster University
description:   Magnetic reconnection is a physical process occurring in plasma, the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the Universe. It entitles a re-arrangement of the plasma magnetic field topology with the release of magnetic energy. The process is ubiquitous in space, where it is at the origin of the northern lights or where it plays a role in eruptive phenomena like solar flares.<br> The video depicts the formation of magnetic islands or plasmoids&colon; closed regions of magnetic field separated by reconnection points. With time these plasmoids attract each other and combine becoming bigger and bigger. The simulation has been performed with the Particle-In-Cell code ECsim on ARCHER. This work shed light on the evolution of reconnection from microscopic kinetic scales to macroscopic scales in perturbed and unperturbed current sheets. It thus helps to improve our understanding of the physics of the inner heliosphere.
