title: Flow visualisation of a membrane bilayer
name: Dr Matthieu Chavent
institution: University of Oxford, SBCB Group, Department of Biochemistry
description:   The cell membrane is a complex and crowded environment with different types of molecules such as lipids and proteins which are  in a dynamic equilibrium. To try to better understand this dynamic behaviour, it is possible to develop theoretical models mimicking  this membrane. Animating such models can be very challenging. Thus we used calculations launched on ARCHER computer to see how the  constituents of this membrane interact together. Inspired by approaches in physics to depict wind or ocean currents we developed a  new way to display collective movements of lipids molecules constituting the <a href="http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/flows/">membrane model</a>.   This visualization allows displaying flow-like movements of lipids. The membrane is a bilayer and we can see that the superimposition  of the two leaflets (left and right) can highlight correlated area of motion (centre). Dark colour low velocity flow, light  colour/white&colon; high velocity flow.
