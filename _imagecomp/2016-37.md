title: Graphene grain boundary
name: Dr. Georg Schusteritsch
institution: Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge
description: Graphene grain boundary structure between armchair and zigzag graphene regions - carbon atoms are shown as spheres. The red transparent region marks the interface between the two so-called grains, forming a continuous chain of pentagons and heptagons in the otherwise pristine graphene. The atomic structure was found using our crystal structure prediction code (AIRSS), implemented to employ the CASTEP code. Polycrystalline materials can today be routinely grown experimentally, but for many of these it is not easy to determine the atomic structures experimentally, making understanding their properties and the underlying physics that govern them a slow, difficult and often expensive task. Polycrystalline materials can today be routinely grown experimentally, but for many of these it is not easy to determine the atomic structures experimentally, making understanding their properties and the underlying physics that govern them a slow, difficult and often expensive task. Crystal structure prediction in combination with the availability of the computational power from ARCHER, can be used to find the atomic structure of interfaces, and thus illustrate a future pathway towards computationally developing materials with specially designed interfaces.
