title: Tingling magnetic field between two collisionless shocks
name: Dr Elisabetta Boella
institution: Lancaster University, Pysics Department
description:  In ionised gases called plasmas, collisions among charged particles can be very rare, almost nonexistent. When this is the case, the formation of shock waves is mediated solely by the self-consistent plasma electromagnetic field. The image illustrates what happens when two shocks of this type interact. A strong magnetic field shows up in the interaction region (colour lines). The field bends the particles and causes them to agglomerate into current filaments (blue colour and projection). This in turn reinforces the field, which becomes stronger and stronger until equilibrium is reached. The simulation has been performed with the massively parallel code OSIRIS on ARCHER2. The work shed light on a physical process poorly understood, namely the collision between shock waves in collisionless plasmas.
