title: Ultrafast electron recollisions in benzene
name: Dr Daniel Dundas
institution: Queen's University Belfast, Atomistic Simulation Centre
description:  We describe how molecules behave when ultrafast laser pulses illuminate them. In this case the laser light is so strong  that it breaks the molecule apart. We are particularly interested in understanding if the laser can be used to control how  the molecule breaks apart, acting like a molecular scissors. The calculations we perform on ARCHER are very demanding. We  describe how the molecule breaks apart using quantum mechanics and this means that even the smallest calculation uses around 1000  cores for over 12 hours. In the image we see how the electrons in the benzene molecule are blown off when the laser light hits  them. Since we use quantum mechanics, the electrons behave like waves and we see these waves sloshing back and forth across the  molecule as the laser drives them.
