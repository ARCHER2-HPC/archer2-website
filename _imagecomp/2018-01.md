title: Atom-by Atom attrition wear of diamond (carbon atom) while scratching pure iron
name: Dr Saurav Goel
institution: Ultra-Precision Engineering, Cranfield University
description:  Despite fifty years of efforts, the scientific community has not yet found a convincing explanation       for the wear mechanism of diamond during ultra-precision machining of low carbon ferrous alloys       or pure iron (a very soft metal). The answer to the wear problem will pave way to low-cost       manufacturing of high-precision moulds required by handheld gadgets and many other precision       applications. This video provides a first direct evidence with high fidelity on the wear of the       diamond tool (blue atoms) while scratching pure iron (grey atoms). The time dependent wear of       diamond is seen to occur at a timestep of (289900) where one small atom (red colour) experience       unbearable strain an is pulled from diamond. The new findings came from molecular dynamics       simulation on ARCHER using long range screening bond order potential function fully       parametrised both for iron and carbon thus highlight importance of simulations in practical       engineering applications.
