title: Heat map of water on a Bassanite slab
name: Stephen Yeandel
institution: Department of Materials Science and Engineering
description:  The calculated average structure of a Bassanite (Calcium Sulphate Hemihydrate) slab, along with the 				 calculated probability of finding a water oxygen atom at a given location on the surface and within the 				 structure itself.  The complex patterns appearing on the surface highlight local structuring of water on a 		 scale inaccessible to experiments, but which can be obtained from atomistic simulations coupled with 				 High-Performance Computers such as ARCHER.  Understanding the atomic scale behaviour of water and other 				 molecules at material surfaces has implications for a wide range of research areas including crystal growth and catalysis.
