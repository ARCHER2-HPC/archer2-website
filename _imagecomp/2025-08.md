title: Mach number flow field over time on OAT15 aerofoil showing transonic buffet
description: This study investigates unsteady shock-wave boundary layer interaction, commonly referred to as transonic buffet, using the open-source Nektar++ flow solver. The geometry under consideration is the ONERA supercritical OAT15 aerofoil, a widely recognized benchmark for transonic buffet research.<br>High-fidelity simulations were performed on the UKTC Archer2 resources in June 2025. The flow conditions correspond to an inflow Mach number of 0.73 and a Reynolds number of 3 million. The simulation successfully reproduced the self-sustained, periodic shock-wave oscillations characteristic of transonic buffet.<br>This work represents both the first application of Nektar++ in a compressible regime at such a high Reynolds number and the first attempt to model and analyse transonic buffet using Nektar++.
