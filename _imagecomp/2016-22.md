title: I spy with my ARCHER t-eye-me, the future of nanoparticle formulations.
name: Ms Ioanna Danai Styliari
institution: Department of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham
description:  This image illustrates a polymer-drug nanoparticle. Producing nanoparticles is a common technique in the pharmaceutical  field to increase the efficacy of poorly water-soluble drugs (grey colour). Most of the times, the formulations produced  include also polymer chains (light and dark blue chains) that interact with the drug, forming a dense particle that can circulate  in the body, and be deposited in the regions of interest.<br /> Experimentally, formulating nanoparticles is a result of many tedious trial-and-error approaches. Simulations performed  in ARCHER using Molecular Dynamics allowed us to replicate an experimental procedure with real-life concentrations that  resulted into the formation of a polymer-drug nanoparticle.<br /> Understanding the interactions between the polymer chains and the drug particles is the stepstone towards a formulation-by-design  approach, that will reduce trial-and-error in the labs and result in better nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.
