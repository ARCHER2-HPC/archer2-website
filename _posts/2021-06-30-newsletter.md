## Parallel Performance Analysis using Scalasca

Online, Tues 27th and Thurs 29th July 2021 09:30 - 16:30 BST

Scalasca is a software tool that supports the performance optimization of parallel programs by measuring and analyzing their runtime behaviour. It uses execution profiles and traces generated by the community-developed Score-P instrumentation and measurement infrastructure. The analysis identifies potential performance bottlenecks – in particular those concerning communication and synchronization – and offers guidance in exploring their causes.

Scalasca targets mainly scientific and engineering applications based on the programming interfaces MPI and OpenMP, including hybrid applications based on a combination of the two. The tool has been specifically designed for use on large-scale systems, but is also well suited for small- and medium-scale HPC platforms. The software is available for free download under the New BSD open-source license.

This online course, delivered by members of the Scalasca development team, will cover how to use the tool in practice. Attendees are encouraged to analyse the performance of their own applications, although example parallel programs will be made available. Practical exercises will be conducted on the UK National HPC Service ARCHER2, an HPE Cray EX system; attendees will be given accounts on ARCHER2 for the duration of the course.
