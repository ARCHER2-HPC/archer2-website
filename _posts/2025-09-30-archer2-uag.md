We were pleased to host the ARCHER2 User Advisory Group at the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) recently, for their regular UAG meeting. 

The ARCHER2 User Advisory Group (UAG) represent current and future users of ARCHER2. They provide oversight and guidance to us, the service provider, and provide recommendations to the Management board. Meetings will cover a range of areas, such as potential issues that might influence the user community, any service improvements, future areas for development and a review of service provider activities.

UAG meetings usually take place online, but this meet was arranged in person, to allow members to see around the facilities. The group saw the current ARCHER2 system, together with the range of other systems hosted at the ACF, including the Tier 2 Cirrus system and Tursa, the Dirac extreme scale system. They were also able to see the machine room that will house the next generation supercomputer. 

Martin Lafferty from HPC gave them a detailed overview of the hardware of ARCHER2, while Daniel Gleed from EPCC led the tour and explained about the plant infrastructure used to support ARCHER2.
