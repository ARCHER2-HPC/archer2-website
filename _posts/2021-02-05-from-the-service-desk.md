Last week marked the end of the ARCHER Service after seven years.

You may have heard some statistics over the last week about ARCHER but I wanted to tell you some from the helpdesk. During the lifetime of ARCHER, the User Support and Systems teams (SP) have resolved 57,489 contractual queries with 98.6% of them being completed within two days. The ARCHER team have also created 6,926 users accounts which have formed our very broad user base ranging from our Driving Test users to our very experienced users.

ARCHER has served the users well. The plot below shows a steady utilisation over the lifetime of the service with it effectively operating around maximum capacity for the majority of the lifetime.

Over the years, the helpdesk has got to know many of you, and we are ready to assist with the transition to ARCHER2. We look forward to continuing to work together with you and our ARCHER2 Service Partners. 

On a personal note, I returned to work at EPCC following a career break around the start of the ARCHER Service. I joined the User Support Team after having previously worked within the HPC Systems Team at EPCC. My youngest was starting school and now as ARCHER ends, so too are his primary years as he approaches the transition to secondary school.
