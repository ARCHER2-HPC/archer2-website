## Slurm maintenance

Wednesday 23rd August 10:00 BST

For a few minutes, users will be unable to submit jobs whilst a roll out of a Slurm configuration change takes place. This change will provide increased resilience and issue monitoring.

## Advanced MPI

6 - 7 september 2023 09:30 - 17:00 BST  Online

This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of MPI and explore some of its more recent and advanced features. We cover topics including exploiting shared-memory access from MPI programs, communicator management and neighbourhood collectives. We also look at performance aspects such as which MPI routines to use for scalability, MPI internal implementation issues and overlapping communication and calculation. Intended learning outcomes

- Understanding of how internal MPI implementation details affect performance
- Techniques for overlapping communications and calculation
- Knowledge of MPI memory models for RMA operations
- Understanding of best practice for MPI+OpenMP programming
- Familiarity with neighbourhood collective operations in MPI

Attendees should be familiar with MPI programming in C, C++ or Fortran, e.g. have attended the ARCHER2 MPI course.

## Reproducible research using containers - introduction to Singularity/Apptainer

[University of Nottingham](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/locations/nottingham), 21 September 2023 09:30 - 16:00 BST 

This course aims to introduce the use of containers with the goal of using them to effect reproducible computational environments. Such environments are useful for ensuring reproducible research outputs and for simplifying the setup of complex software dependencies across different systems. The course will introduce the use of Singularity/Apptainer containers but the material will be of use for whatever container technology you plan to, or end up, using. On completion of this course attendees should:

- Have an understanding of what Singularity/Apptainer containers are, why they are useful and the common terminology used
- Have a working Singularity/Apptainer installation on your local system to allow you to use containers
- Understand how to use existing Docker/Singularity/Apptainer containers for common tasks
- Be able to build your own Singularity/Apptainer containers by understanding both the role of a recipe in building containers, and the syntax used in Singularity/Apptainer recipes
- Understand how to manage Singularity/Apptainer containers on your local system
- Appreciate decisions that need to be made around containerising research workflows
- Appreciate issues around reproducibility in software, understand how containers can address some of these issues and what the limits to reproducibility using containers are
