## ARCHER2 Charging of Jobs begins 1st April 2021

A reminder that we will be introducing charging of jobs against budgets from 1 April 2021. 

Project budgets have been transferred over from ARCHER, converted to ARCHER2 CU (for those projects continuing), and new budgets created for new projects on ARCHER2. The conversion rate for ARCHER kAU to ARCHER2 CU is 1 ARCHER2 CU = 1.536 ARCHER kAU. In identifying these conversion rates UKRI has endeavoured to ensure that no user will be disadvantaged by the transfer of their allocation from ARCHER to ARCHER2. 

If you have any questions about the new budgets, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the [ARCHER2 Service Desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk).
 

## Service Desk closure over Easter

- Service Desk is closed on Friday 2nd April and Monday 5th April.
- Service Desk resumes at 8am on Tuesday 6th April.


## Quantum Computing Without A Quantum Computer

Online webinar, Wednesday 31st March 2021 15:00 - 16:00 BST

Quantum computers offer the exciting prospect of one day tackling problems that are intractable on classical computers, but what do you do if you don’t actually have one? Dr Oliver Thomson Brown gives a (very) brief intro to quantum computing, and shows how ARCHER2 is enabling researchers to study quantum algorithms so that when we do have access to quantum computers, we’ll have something to run on them.

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.

## Access to HPC call open

The Access to High Performance Computing Call, through which EPSRC users can access the council's new and upcoming Tier-1 and Tier-2 resources has now gone live:
