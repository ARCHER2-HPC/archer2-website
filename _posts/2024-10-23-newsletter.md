## Exploring new computational frontiers with SmartSim

Webinar, Thursday 24th October 2024 15:00 - 16:00

Over the last two decades, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been gaining popularity among high performance computing (HPC) scientists. Enhancing state-of-the-art numerical workflows with AI components can lead to two main improvements: the discovery of new results and the optimisation of the computational resources needed to obtain them. The integration of ML workflows and more traditional numerical software can be difficult due to differences in how these computational paradigms are developed and deployed on large systems.

In this webinar, we introduce SmartSim, a portable open-source framework maintained by HPE, which can be used to couple HPC applications and ML toolkits. Using exemplar use cases from Computational Fluid Dynamics and Climate Modelling, we will show how these new AI-enhanced workflows can be used for scientific discovery. First, we will describe how SmartSim has been used on ARCHER2’s small GPU development platform and then present the experience of one research group who are coupling machine learning and Xcompact3D to improve the power output of wind farms by introducing dynamic wake steering.

## Single Node Performance Optimisation

12 - 13 November 2024 09:30 - 17:30 Day 1, 09:30 - 16.30 Day 2, Edinburgh

This course covers techniques for improving the performance of parallel applications by optimising of the code that runs within each node.

Modern HPC systems such as ARCHER2 are being constructed using increasingly powerful nodes, with larger and larger numbers of cores and enhanced vector capabilities. To extract maximum performance from applications, it is therefore necessary to understand, and be able to overcome, on-node performance bottlenecks. This course will cover the main features of modern HPC nodes, including multiple cores, vector floating point units, deep cache hierarchies, and NUMA memory systems. We will cover techniques for efficient programming of these features, using batch processing options and compiler options as well as hand tuning of code. The course will also contain an introduction to the use of Cray performance analysis tools.
Prerequisites:

Participants must be familiar with software development on ARCHER2, or any other HPC facility, using C, C++ or Fortran.

This course is targeted at users interested in optimising the performance of their own applications, e.g. through compiler options or code changes.

## Message Passing programming with MPI

26 - 27 November 2024 09:00 - 17:00, Birmingham,  Tuesday 3rd December 14:00 to 16:30 online

The world’s largest supercomputers are used almost exclusively to run applications which are parallelised using Message Passing. The course covers all the basic knowledge required to write parallel programs using this programming model, and is directly applicable to almost every parallel computer architecture.

Parallel programming by definition involves co-operation between processors to solve a common task. The programmer has to define the tasks that will be executed by the processors, and also how these tasks are to synchronise and exchange data with one another. In the message-passing model the tasks are separate processes that communicate and synchronise by explicitly sending each other messages. All these parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing interface that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network linking the actual processors together. This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI). It covers point-to-point communication, non-blocking operations, derived datatypes, virtual topologies, collective communication and general design issues.

## ARCHER2 Calendar 2025

As in previous years, we plan to produce a printed calendar featuring some of the images from the competition – you are most warmly invited to [sign up to receive a copy](https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-Calendar-2025), and these will be posted out in time for the new year.



## Accessibility of EPSRC Large Scale Facilities - User survey 

We have been asked by EPSRC to circulate this survey to all users to collect the experiences of facility users.

With this survey their aim is not to single out any individual facilities but instead to identify and share what is working well. Once they have analysed the responses, the aggregated results will be shared with all the facilities, so we can jointly explore ways in which the range of facilities can become more inclusive, e.g. through good practice sharing.

[Complete the survey](  https://engagementhub.ukri.org/epsrc-researchinfrastructure/lsfusersurvey/)

EPSRC are keen to reach as many users as possible, to help them understand what barriers, if any, exist to providing greater accessibility.

Please do complete the survey.
