We are pleased to announce that we have recently passed a flurry of ISO certifications.

We had a combined external audit for ISO 9001 Quality and 27001 Information Security from our certification body DNV  in September.  This looked at how we run the ARCHER2 and Cirrus services on the ISO 9001 side, how well we meet our users’ requirements and incorporate their feedback to improve our service delivery.  For ISO 27001 the auditor looked at our information security policies and processes, the technical security measures that are in place and how we handle incidents when they occur.   We were delighted to pass with flying colours.

In October we had an external audit for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (ISO 22301) for the first time.  This looked at our processes for assessing risks to the services we run, putting in measures to minimise the number and the impacts of outages and the tests we carry out to ensure these measures are effective.  As it was our first external audit for this standard we weren’t very sure what to expect, but the auditor was very pleased with the measures and tests put in place and we were very happy to have passed with minimum findings needing changes.
