## ARCHER2 Annual User Survey 2021-22

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 Annual User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.

We are also offering 5 prizes of 2000 CUs on ARCHER2 for users who complete the survey. Winners can choose to forgo the CU prize and for each winner that does this we will donate a further £20 to [Save The Children](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk). Winners will be drawn at random from all respondents who have left contact details after the closing date of Thursday 30th June 2022 and the winners notified by e-mail. The prizes are only available to people with existing ARCHER2 user accounts.

You can find the survey at:

 <https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2021-2022>

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.


## Large node count jobs now more stable

We are aware that a number of users running jobs which use large numbers of nodes (typically hundreds or thousands of nodes) have seen a high failure rate for jobs over the past few weeks. We have identified and fixed an issue with the interconnect interface on a number of compute nodes that would have caused these failures. Our testing now indicates that the jobs using large node counts should no longer exhibit these high failure rates.

Please do let the [service desk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html) know if you continue to experience issues with large scale jobs on ARCHER2.


## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call

We are very pleased to announce that the 7th ARCHER2 eCSE call (ARCHER2
eCSE07) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation is 16:00 on 24th May 2022 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 14th June 2022.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding of between 1 and 12 person months inclusive for RSEs (Research Software Engineers, PDRAs or
equivalent) to carry out software development of codes to be run on the
ARCHER2 system. The code(s) may already be running on ARCHER2, where the aim is to improve performance or scalability, to add functionality or to improve the usability and maintainability, or the code(s) may be running elsewhere (e.g. on a Tier-2 system) and the proposal could be to bring the software up to a level where it would perform well on ARCHER2.

For this call, software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC is eligible. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of the above.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/>

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.

### eCSE call dates

Deadline for submitting eCSE07 documents for technical evaluation: 16:00 on Tuesday 24th May 2022

which includes a walk through of the submission of a proposal.

### eCSE Webinar Thurs 28th April at 3pm

This eCSE Webinar  provides an overview of the eCSE programme, examples of work carried out during eCSE projects, and describes the submission process including all the technical and logistical aspects of putting together a proposal. There will be the opportunity to ask questions about any aspect of the programme.

### eCSE Tutorial - Preparing an eCSE Proposal (09:30-12:30 10th May 2022)

In addition to the eCSE webinar, we would like to invite you to this workshop which will take prospective candidates (PIs and RSEs) through the process of preparing a proposal from the initial idea, right through to submitting the final proposal. We will discuss how to put a project team together, how to deal with any associated costings, and will include all the various aspects of the application form within the SAFE and any additional documents required. There will be lots of time for questions.
