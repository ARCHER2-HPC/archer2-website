## ARCHER2 Full System Transition

Charging was enabled on ARCHER2 full system from 4th January 2022.  This means that all jobs which ended after 10:00 GMT on Tuesday 4th January will be charged.

ARCHER2 4-Cabinet system service ended at noon on Monday 10th January 2022.

Transition to the ARCHER2 Full System is now complete.


## Modelling volcanic plumes using ARCHER2

Webinar Wednesday 12th January 2022 15:00 - 16:00

In the event of a volcanic eruption it is vital to be able to predict the spread of ash and gas. This is particularly challenging near to the eruption site, and when the eruption occurs in a region with a high degree of geographical complexity, such as Iceland. This presentation will describe some of the basics of modelling volcanic plume dispersion. From simplified models of volcanic plumes and how they are affected by winds, to highly complex simulations that capture the spread of volcanic gases across Iceland, ARCHER2 has been used to simulate volcanic plume behaviour. Such simulations were used actively in the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption. An emergency allocation was granted on ARCHER2 and simulations were performed operationally and shared with colleagues in Iceland.

## Integrating discrete exterior calculus (DEC) into the ParaFEM library

Webinar Thursday 13th January 2022 15:00 - 16:00

Leveraging 30+ years of development to accelerate new research

This presentation will describe the creation of a sustainable and efficient HPC platform for non-smooth (discrete & discontinuous) mechanics by integrating the first parallelised discrete exterior calculus (DEC) math library into the well-established open-source FE library ParaFEM. DEC is a relatively new mathematical framework in solid mechanics built on a discrete view of the world, making it ideal for simulating non-smooth physical processes at a fundamental level. Integrating the libraries has accelerated the development and application of DEC, as well as related methods, through the reuse of optimised code for partitioning & load balancing, parallel I/O, inter-process communication patterns, and scalable solvers. We will discuss some of the performance benefits realised in four mini-applications for (steady, transient, and heterogeneous) diffusion and elastic problems, as well as the challenges encountered through this process. We will also discuss some of the opportunities this project has created to integrate DEC into existing ParaFEM frameworks for multiscale and multiphysics problems.

## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call

We are very pleased to announce that the 6th ARCHER2 eCSE call (ARCHER2 eCSE06) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation is 16:00 on 22nd Feb 2022 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 15th Mar 2022.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on the ARCHER2 system. For this call, software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC is eligible. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of the above. Proposals may request effort from between 1 and 12 person months (inclusive).

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/>

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.

### eCSE call dates


Deadline for submitting eCSE06 documents for technical evaluation: 16:00 on Tuesday 22nd February 2022

Deadline for final eCSE06 submission: 16:00 Tuesday 15th March 2022
