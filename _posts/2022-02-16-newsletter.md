## The Hitchhikers' Guide to ARCHER2

Online webinar, Wednesday 2nd March 2022 15:00 - 16:00
 
ARCHER2 is the UK’s Tier-1 supercomputing service. First-time users of HPC may be unsure of what to expect, and those coming from other services will notice differences. In this webinar I will provide an overview of the system’s hardware and software and cover basic usage such as logging in, compiling code, and running jobs.

Questions from attendees will be welcome.

This online session is open to all.
