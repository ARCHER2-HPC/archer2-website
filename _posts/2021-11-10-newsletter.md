## Introduction to the full ARCHER2 system

Webinar, Wednesday 17th November 2021 15:00 - 16:00

In this webinar we will introduce the full ARCHER2 service that will shortly be available. In particular, we will cover the process of migrating from the ARCHER2 4-cabinet service to the full service and review the key differences between the 4-cabinet system and the full system.

We will also share any tips from the EPCC and HPE teams on getting the most out of the full system.

There will be plenty of opportunity for questions as part of this webinar.

## EPSRC Access to HPC call 

EPSRC have opened their latest Access to HPC call.

Deadline for submission of TAs is 17 November 2021 16:00 and the closing date for applications is 15 December 2021 16:00.

## ARCHER2 for Software Developers

Online 	29 - 30 November 2021 10:00 - 16:00 GMT 

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
   - What does they consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
   - How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 application development environment look like and how do I use it?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?

**Target Audience:**

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for user who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to compile (and possibly) develop HPC software on ARCHER2.

**Prerequisites:**

You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line. You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using scp). Finally, you should be comfortable with compiling parallel HPC source code that uses MPI and OpenMP.

## ARCHER2 for Package Users

Online  2 December 2021 10:00 - 16:00 GMT

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
- What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
- How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
- What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?

## HPC-Europa3 Transnational Access visitor programme

FINAL call for applications: closing date 11th November 2021.

HPC-Europa3 funds collaborative research visits for computational scientists in any discipline which can use High Performance Computing (HPC). Visits can currently be made to research institutes in Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or the UK. UK-based researchers can benefit in two ways: either by visiting a research group elsewhere in Europe, or by hosting a research visitor from another country.

### What does HPC-Europa3 provide?

- Funding for travel, living and accommodation expenses for visits of up to 13 weeks.
- Access to world-class High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.
- Technical support to help you make best use of the HPC systems.
- Collaborative environment with an expert in your field of research.

### Who can apply?

- Researchers of all levels, from postgraduate to full professors.
- Researchers from academia or industry.
- Researchers currently working in a European Union country or Associated State (see http://bit.ly/AssociatedStates for full list of Associated States).
- Researchers may not visit a group in the country where they currently work.
- A small number of places may be available for researchers working outside these countries - please contact staff@hpc-europa.org for more information.

### How do I apply?

Apply online at <http://www.hpc-europa.org> by 11th November 2021.

This is the FINAL closing date for applications under HPC-Europa3.

Applicants should receive the selection panelâ€™s decision in late December, so visits should be planned for no earlier than mid-January. However, ALL visits must be complete by 30th April 2022, when the programme ends. 

For more information and to apply online, visit: <http://www.hpc-europa.org/>
