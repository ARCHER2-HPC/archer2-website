## Introduction to Bash

Online, Wednesday 28th June 2023 15:00 - 16:00 

Bash can be used in a variety of ways to help with workflows on ARCHER2, in particular as a scripting language.

This webinar will introduce some of the basic concepts and features, as well as giving an insight into how it can be used specifically on ARCHER2

## ARCHER2 Publication Database: 

The ARCHER2 service maintains a publication database of works that have arisen from ARCHER2 and links them to project IDs that have ARCHER2 access. We ask all users of ARCHER2 to register any publications in the database - all you need is your publication's DOI.

Registering your publications in SAFE has a number of advantages:
-	For large projects in particular, it allows the project lead to collect publications from all the project members to assist with ResearchFish submissions
-	Your publication automatically gets added to the ARCHER2 publications page
-	Your publication is included in reports to UKRI
-	The better the record we have of publications arising from the ARCHER2 service, the easier it is to demonstrate the impacts and benefits of the service; allowing UKRI to secure funding for future national supercomputing services.
