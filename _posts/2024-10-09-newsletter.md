## Message Passing programming with MPI

26 - 27 November 2024 09:00 - 17:00, Birmingham,  Tuesday 3rd December 14:00 to 16:30 online

The worldâ€™s largest supercomputers are used almost exclusively to run applications which are parallelised using Message Passing. The course covers all the basic knowledge required to write parallel programs using this programming model, and is directly applicable to almost every parallel computer architecture.

Parallel programming by definition involves co-operation between processors to solve a common task. The programmer has to define the tasks that will be executed by the processors, and also how these tasks are to synchronise and exchange data with one another. In the message-passing model the tasks are separate processes that communicate and synchronise by explicitly sending each other messages. All these parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing interface that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network linking the actual processors together. This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI). It covers point-to-point communication, non-blocking operations, derived datatypes, virtual topologies, collective communication and general design issues.

## Intermediate Research Software Development

26 - 28 November 2024 09:30 - 17:00
Queen's University, Belfast

This course aims to teach a core set of established, intermediate-level software development skills and best practices for working as part of a team in a research environment using Python as an example programming language (see detailed Learning objectives below). The core set of skills we teach is not a comprehensive set of all-encompassing skills, but a selective set of tried-and-tested collaborative development skills that forms a firm foundation for continuing on your learning journey.

## GeoChemFoam on Archer2 for Pore-Scale Modelling - eCSE project

GeoChemFoam is for researching pore-scale processes related to the energy transition and our NetZero carbon future, simulating flow, reactions, and transport in 3D images obtained from X-ray micro-computed tomography.

Do you have work done on ARCHER2 or through eCSE funding that you want to share across a wider community? If so, please [get in touch](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) with details and we will be happy to add it to the weekly ARCHER2 newsletter.


## Accessibility of EPSRC Large Scale Facilities - User survey 

We have been asked by EPSRC to circulate this survey to all users to collect the experiences of facility users.

With this survey their aim is not to single out any individual facilities but instead to identify and share what is working well. Once they have analysed the responses, the aggregated results will be shared with all the facilities, so we can jointly explore ways in which the range of facilities can become more inclusive, e.g. through good practice sharing.

[Complete the survey](  https://engagementhub.ukri.org/epsrc-researchinfrastructure/lsfusersurvey/)

EPSRC are keen to reach as many users as possible, to help them understand what barriers, if any, exist to providing greater accessibility.

Please do complete the survey.
