## Modelling Cake Formation in a Centrifugal Filter using the Discrete Element Method on ARCHER2

Online webinar, Wednesday 15th June 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST
 
In this webinar the presenter will discuss a widely-applied downstream operation from the bio/chemical industry, describing the challenges in modelling this particular operation and potential improvements using the discrete element method in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics. The presenter will describe the methodology used to model the system in detail, simplifications, the computational efficiency of such computations on HPC and how HPC-Europa3 mobility enabled improvements to this doctoral research.

## SC22 SciViz Showcase call


Submissions are invited for this year’s most instrumental videos in HPC - closes on 5th August

[SC22 SciVis Showcase call](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/program/posters/scientific-visualization-data-analytics-showcase/)

For inspiration last year's (SC21) finalist movies are available on the SC YouTube channel ["SciViz Showcase" playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyZk_jpQ4X_pQAUzmUG17DBQnrlN2zIyE), along with a [short showreel of highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-6lp8316cA&list=PLyZk_jpQ4X_pQAUzmUG17DBQnrlN2zIyE&index=1).



## Advanced Message-Passing Programming 

Online training, 29 - 30 June 2022 09:30 - 17:00 GMT 

This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of MPI and explore some of its more recent and advanced features. We cover topics including exploiting shared-memory access from MPI programs, communicator management and neighbourhood collectives. We also look at performance aspects such as which MPI routines to use for scalability, MPI internal implementation issues and overlapping communication and calculation. Intended learning outcomes

- Understanding of how internal MPI implementation details affect performance
- Techniques for overlapping communications and calculation
- Knowledge of MPI memory models for RMA operations
- Understanding of best practice for MPI+OpenMP programming
-  Familiarity with neighbourhood collective operations in MPI

## GPU Programming with CUDA

27 June 2022 10:00 - 17:00 BST
The Open University, Milton Keynes

Please note: This is not an ARCHER2 course but is advertised here as likely to be of interest to many members of the ARCHER2 commnunity.  This course will run on [Cirrus](https://www.cirrus.ac.uk), not ARCHER2.

This short course will provide an introduction to GPU computing with CUDA aimed at scientific application programmers. The course will give a background on the difference between CPU and GPU architectures as a prelude to introductory exercises in CUDA programming. The course will discuss the execution of kernels, memory management, and shared memory operations. Common performance issues are discussed and their solution addressed. The course will also cover some of the alternatives to CUDA commonly available (OpenCL, OpenACC, and Kokkos) at the current time.

Templates will be provided to do the practical examples in Python using PyCUDA, although this still requires the computational kernels to be written in C.

Note: this course will not address machine learning or any machine learning frameworks.

## ARCHER2 Annual User Survey 2021-22

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 Annual User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.

We are also offering 5 prizes of 2000 CUs on ARCHER2 for users who complete the survey. Winners can choose to forgo the CU prize and for each winner that does this we will donate a further £20 to [Save The Children](www.savethechildren.org.uk). Winners will be drawn at random from all respondents who have left contact details after the closing date of Thursday 30th June 2022 and the winners notified by e-mail. The prizes are only available to people with existing ARCHER2 user accounts.

You can find the survey at:

 <https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2021-2022>

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.
