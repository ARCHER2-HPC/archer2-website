## The Driving Test

The [ARCHER2 Driving Test](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/driving-test.html) is an online assessment tool which allows those new to ARCHER2 to demonstrate that they are sufficiently familiar with ARCHER2 and HPC to start making use of it.

On successful completion of the Driving Test (which has options for Software Developers and  for those who only use existing software packages) they are invited to apply for an account on ARCHER2 and awarded a small allowance of 800 CUs to use to run jobs over a period of up to 12 months.


The Driving Test has been very popular and successful; since its launch in 2022, over 200 people have passed and 144 have had an account on ARCHER2
