### What are we looking for?

The ARCHER2 Image Competition is an event for all users of ARCHER/ARCHER2 to share their images or videos of "ARCHER Enabling Research"

We are looking for entries that will demonstrate the contribution of ARCHER to research.

Entries might include (but are not limited to):

-    images generated from calculations that used ARCHER
-    photographs of equipment and/or researchers working on projects which use ARCHER for computation
-    images generated from data processed using ARCHER
-    images demonstrating the contribution of ARCHER to research
-    videos or animations generated from data processed using ARCHER
-    images or videos showing the impact of research carried out on ARCHER
-    infographic (still, video, cartoon, diagram) showing how ARCHER has contributed to your research or knowledge, or how it is part of your research process

Images don't need to have been generated in the last few months - any images from any time in the ARCHER service, including photos relating to your work, and images or videos that have been post-processed.
