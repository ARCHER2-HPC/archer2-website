## Performance of different routing protocols on ARCHER2: OpenFabrics and UCX, 

Online webinar, Wednesday 20th July 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST

In this presentation, we report on a comparison on performance between different routing protocols underlying the Cray MPICH library on a HPE Cray EX system for a variety of application and synthetic benchmarks. The ARCHER2 system allows users to select, at runtime, between two different underlying routing protocols: OpenFabrics (OFI) and Mellanox UCX (UCX). The CSE team have compared the performance of OFI and UCX for different applications from a variety of research areas (CASTEP, CP2K, GROMACS, NEMO, OpenSBLI, VASP) and the performance of the OSU MPI benchmarks. We find that the choice of routing protocol can have a profound effect on application performance and that the best choice is dependent on the number of nodes, the application and the benchmark case used for the performance evaluation. This makes providing general advice to users challenging. We summarise the data we have gathered so far and the advice we provide to users; and provide an overview of what future investigations we have planned.

## Plotting and Programming with Python

Online training,  25 July 2022 10:00 - 17:00 BST

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example. Please note that this lesson uses Python 3.

This one-day course aims to answer the following questions:

How do I…

-     …read tabular data?
-     …plot a single vector of values?
-     …create a time series plot?
-     …create one plot for each of several data sets?
-     …get extra data from a single data set for plotting?
-     …write programs I can read and re-use in future?

## HPC Carpentry

Online, 26 - 27 July 2022 09:30 - 16:00 BST

This course introduces accessing remote advanced computing facilities via the command line and High Performance Computing (HPC). After completing this course, participants will:

- Understand motivations for using HPC in research.
- Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops.
- Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data.
- Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems.
- Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system.
- Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software.
- Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource.
