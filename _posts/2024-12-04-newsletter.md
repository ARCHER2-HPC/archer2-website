## Estimating ARCHER2 emissions

In a [recent blog post](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/news/2024/11/28/emissions.html) we report on work we have been doing to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the ARCHER2 service. We introduce the different categories of emissions and how they apply to ARCHER2, how ARCHER2 can potentially reduce emissions, describe the methodology we use to estimate emissions from the service and the new tools we have developed to help users estimate the emissions from their use of ARCHER2. 



## ARCHER2 Calendar 2025

As in previous years, we have produced a printed calendar featuring some of the images from the competition â€“ you are most warmly invited to [sign up to receive a copy](https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-Calendar-2025), and these will be posted out in time for the new year.


## Data carpentry

Cardiff, 30 - 31 January 2025 09:30 - 17:00 GMT

Data Carpentry workshops will focus on introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. It is ideal training for researchers wishing to learn how to use open source tools to make their research open and reproducible. you do not need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This two-day workshop will cover:

-     Data Organization in Spreadsheets
-     Data Cleaning with OpenRefine
-     Data Analysis and Visualization in R
-     Data Management with SQL

This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset from the Portal Project Teaching Database and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualization. would use.

There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher
