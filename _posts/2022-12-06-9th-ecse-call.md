We are very pleased to announce that the 9th ARCHER2 eCSE call
(ARCHER2-eCSE09) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation is 16:00 on 21st February 2023 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 14th March 2023.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding for RSEs (Research Software Engineers, PDRAs or equivalent) to carry out software development of codes to be run on the ARCHER2 system.

Projects can be requested for up to 18 person months of effort per project. We hope that this recent increase in the effort available per project will provide researchers with the opportunity to carry out more in depth improvements to software and to allow for an increase in the scope of a project's objectives. There is flexibility in the way the effort is requested. For example, a project may have more than one person working on it or the effort could be spread over a greater number of calendar months, i.e. a staff member could work on the project at less than 100% alongside other commitments or it could be worked on by a staff member who doesn't work full time. Please just get in contact with the ARCHER2 Service Desk if you wish to discuss possible scenarios.

The code(s) may already be running on ARCHER2, where the aim is to improve performance or scalability, to add functionality or to improve the usability and maintainability, or the code(s) may be running elsewhere (e.g. on a Tier-2 system) and the proposal could be to bring the software up to a level where it would perform well on ARCHER2.

For this call, software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC is eligible. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of the above.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the [eCSE calls page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/) together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.
