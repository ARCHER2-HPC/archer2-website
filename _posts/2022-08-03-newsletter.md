## Automated service monitoring in the deployment of ARCHER2

Online webinar, Wednesday 3rd August 2022 13:00 - 14:00 BST 
Kieran Leach EPCC

The ARCHER2 service, a CPU based HPE Cray EX system with 750,080 cores (5,860 nodes), has been deployed throughout 2020 and 2021, going into full service in December of 2021.

A key part of the work during this deployment was the integration of ARCHER2 into our local monitoring systems.

As ARCHER2 was one of the very first large-scale EX deployments, this involved close collaboration and development work with the HPE team through a global pandemic situation where collaboration and co-working was significantly more challenging than usual. The deployment included the creation of automated checks and visual representations of system status which needed to be made available to external parties for diagnosis and interpretation.

We will describe how these checks have been deployed and how data gathered played a key role in the deployment of ARCHER2, the commissioning of the plant infrastructure, the conduct of HPL runs for submission to the Top500 and contractual monitoring of the availability of the ARCHER2 service during its commissioning and early life.

## Efficient Parallel IO

One of the greatest challenges to running parallel applications on large numbers of processors is how to handle file IO. Standard Unix IO routines are not designed with parallelism in mind, and IO overheads can grow to dominate the overall runtime. Parallel file systems are optimised for large volumes of data, but performance can be far from optimal if every process opens its own file or if all IO is funnelled through a single controller process.

This hands-on course explores a range of issues related to parallel IO. It uses ARCHER2 and its parallel Lustre file system as a platform for the exercises; however, almost all the IO concepts and performance considerations are applicable to any parallel system.

## Pre-announcement of the HPC-AI Advisory Council UK conference: 19/20 October 2022, Leicester.

The annual UK conference of the HPC-AI Advisory Council is back to being an in-person event. The 2022 conference will be in Leicester on 19/20 October.

The three coupled themes for the 2 days are:
1. The importance of large-scale computing
2. Sustainability and net-zero in large-scale computing
3. The vital role of DRI professional

The deadline for submitting contributed talk abstracts is August 17th.
