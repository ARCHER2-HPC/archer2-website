## Major software upgrade

The major software upgrade started on Friday 19th May and is progressing well.

During this time ARCHER2 is unavailable and all user data (```/home```, ```/work```, ```/epsrc``` and ```/general```) is inaccessible. We have also disabled some SAFE functionality as the actions cannot be completed without ARCHER2 access. This includes approving new user accounts and viewing or changing storage quotas. 

For EPSRC projects, we will extend the current allocations to compensate for the ARCHER2 outage and the extensions will be in place when ARCHER2 is returned to service. 

Details of the upgrade which will be updated throughout the upgrade process can be found on the [upgrade webpage: ](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/faq/upgrade-2023/)

Following the upgrade, we would advise users to recompile and test your codes as the new software will be based on a new operating system and new versions of compilers and libraries. The ARCHER2 CSE team will be recompiling and testing all centrally installed software. There will be no Python 2 installation available as part of supported software following the upgrade. Python 3 will continue to be fully supported.

### Online User Forum: Wednesday 7th June 1400 BST

An online User Forum will take place on Wednesday 7th June at 1400 BST.
EPCC and HPE Staff will present information regarding the upgrade including new features and changes to the user environment. It will also give you an opportunity to ask any questions to HPE and EPCC staff.
