We recently received the main ARCHER2 hardware at the ACF and our team recorded the process of installation as this exciting new system was deployed.

You’ll see large “Mountain” cabinets being deployed each of which holds 256 Compute Nodes with 128 CPU cores each as well as a number of smaller cabinets which contain storage and support systems. When the full system is deployed later this year we’ll have 5848 Compute Nodes for a total of 748,544 cores!

Particular thanks go to Connor, Jordan, Craig, and Calum at the ACF and to Spyro for putting this video together. We're incredibly excited to say #helloARCHER2 and we hope you are too!
