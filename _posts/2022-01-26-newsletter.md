## ARCHER2 Driving Test


We are delighted to announce that the ARCHER2 Driving Test is now available.

The ARCHER2 Driving Test is an online assessment tool which allows those new to ARCHER2 to demonstrate that they are sufficiently familiar with ARCHER2 and HPC to start making use of it.

It is suitable for anyone who has completed an Introduction to ARCHER2 training course (or followed the material online) - either for Package Users or for Software Developers, or for users of other HPC systems who have familiarised themselves with the specifics of running jobs on ARCHER2 by reading up the appropriate preparation material resources.

On successful completion of the Driving Test, you will be invited to apply for an account on ARCHER2 and awarded a small allowance to use to run jobs over a period of up to 12 months.

Full details, and take the test: <https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/driving-test.html>
