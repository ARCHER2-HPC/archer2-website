## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2026

We are pleased to announce that [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2026](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2026/) will take place on the 19th - 20th March 2026 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh.

Please **[register here](https://forms.office.com/e/bYHMcP8KLc)** to participate. The event is in-person and there is no registration fee. 


### What to expect at ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 

ARCHER2 Celebration of Science is annual event that brings together the ARCHER2 user community to celebrate their scientific achievements on ARCHER2. You can explore the [highlights of previous events here]({{ base-url }}/community/events/#previous-events) and view the science showcased in the previous years. 


The two-day programme of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2026 will include: 

-    **Invited talks**: a variety of talks from the invited speakers highlighting their impactful research using ARCHER2. 
-    **Poster programme**: a platform for the ARCHER2 community to present and discuss their successes delivered on ARCHER2 through the lightning talks and the poster session. A Best Poster Prize will be awarded. - [Call for Posters]({{ base-url }}/community/events/celebration-of-science-2026#call-for-posters) is now open!  
-    **Keynote**: the keynote will be given by Professor Mark Parsons, Director of EPCC. 
-    **Panel Session**: focuses on key topics for the ARCHER2 and UK research community. 
-    **ARCHER2 User Forum**: learn about the latest service updates and engage directly with the ARCHER2 team. 
-    **Diversity Session**: an interactive session to discuss the equality, diversity and inclusion challenges related to the delivery of HPC services. 

[Registration](https://forms.office.com/e/bYHMcP8KLc), and [Call for posters]({{ base-url }}/community/events/celebration-of-science-2026#call-for-posters) are open now.  [Full details here ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2026/)



## JAX for scientific computing

Free webinar, Wednesday 17th December 2025 15:00 - 16:00

JAX is an open-source Python package for high-performance numerical computing. It provides a familiar NumPy style interface but with the advantages of allowing computations to be dispatched to accelerator devices such as graphics and tensor processing units, and supporting transformations to automatically differentiate, vectorize and just-in-time compile functions. While extensively used in machine learning applications, JAX’s design also makes it ideal for scientific computing tasks such as simulating numerical models and fitting them to data.

This webinar will introduce JAX’s interface, its computation model and functional transforms, and illustrate how it can be used in an example task of fitting the parameters of a numerical model given data. The webinar will also demonstrate how the Array API can be used to write portable code which works across JAX, NumPy and other array backends.

## NFCS Network Plus project, UKRI research data landscape survey

The National Federation of Compute Services (NFCS)  is exploring the benefits that establishing a federation of national, regional, and institutional computing resources within the UK could provide to researchers and service providers. Towards this end, we are seeking input from those who generate datasets through their research that they may make available through data publishing services, and also from those who run these services, as data is seen as an important component of these federations. 

We would be grateful if you could [complete the survey](
 https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/edinburgh/nfcs-survey)
 
You can fill this as a person who generates data and may make it available through a data publishing service, or as one of the people that runs such as a service, or, if you participate in both roles, as both. It should not take more than 25 minutes to fill in the survey per role. 

We are hoping for as wide a participation in this survey as possible so please share this with your colleagues. 

The survey closes on 31st March 2026.  Thank you for your participation.
