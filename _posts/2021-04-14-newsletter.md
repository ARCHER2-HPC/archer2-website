## Efficient use of the HPE Cray EX Supercomputer ARCHER2

Online training, 20 - 22 April 2021 09:00 - 17:00 BST 

This three day workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to understand the most optimal way to port, execute and optimize applications for ARCHER2. The workshop is a mixture of lectures and practical hands-on sessions. Example exercises will be provided but attendees are encouraged to bring their own applications.

*This is an opportunity to learn about the new system, direct from HPE Cray Centre of Excellence experts, and we do not expect to be able to repeat this opportunity in the near future.  No recordings will be provided so we encourage you to sign up now to ensure your place.*

## Understanding Package Performance

Online training, 19 April 2021 9:00 - 16:15 BST 
 
As parallel packages for computational science become more sophisticated, it becomes more difficult for a researcher to understand the most important factors that determine end-to-end productivity from initial input data to final result. Aspects such as file IO and data transfer can be just as important in practice as the performance and parallel scalability of the application itself. This course provides an introduction to understanding your research workflow, the place of HPC application performance within the workflow, an introduction to benchmarking parallel applications and how you can use benchmark data to make decisions on running your research on HPC systems.

## High Performance Containers?

Wednesday 21st April 2021 15:00 - 16:00 BST
 
Containers are a convenient means of encapsulating complex software environments, but can this convenience be realised for parallel research codes?

Running such codes costs money, which means that code performance is often tuned to specific supercomputer platforms. Therefore, for containers to be useful in the world of HPC, it must be possible to capture this specialisation within a single container. Indeed a container should be dedicated to one research code and have the ability to run efficiently on multiple HPC platforms.

This presentation will explore a workflow that attempts to achieve this aim using Singularity containers based on the bind model.

This online session is free of charge and open to all.

## RDFaaS available from ARCHER2

The RDF data is now available on RDF as a Service (RDFaaS).  
ARCHER2 users can access the data from the ARCHER2 User Access Nodes (UANs) using 

`cd /epsrc/your_project_code ` <br />
`cd /general/your_project_code `

The data is currently read-only so you are able to access the data and make a copy if needed but you are not able to write to the space during the ARCHER2 4Cabinet service. 

**Note**: as previously notified, `/nerc` is no longer available

If the data you wish to access is from an old ARCHER project which is not on ARCHER2, then please contact the Service Desk ([support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)) and we can make arrangements so that you are able to access the data.  


## HPC-Europa3 Transnational Access visitor programme 

Call for applications: next closing date 13th May 2021. 

HPC-Europa3 funds collaborative research visits for computational scientists in any discipline which can use High Performance Computing (HPC). Visits can be made to research institutes in Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or the UK. UK-based researchers can benefit in two ways: either by visiting a research group elsewhere in Europe, or by hosting a research visitor from another country. 

### What does HPC-Europa3 provide? 

- Funding for travel, living and accommodation expenses for visits of up to 13 weeks. 
- Access to world-class High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. 
- Technical support to help you make best use of the HPC systems. 
- Collaborative environment with an expert in your field of research. 

### Who can apply? 

- Researchers of all levels, from postgraduate to full professors. 
- Researchers from academia or industry. 
- Researchers currently working in a European Union country or Associated State (see [http://bit.ly/AssociatedStates](http://bit.ly/AssociatedStates) for full list of Associated States). 
- Researchers may not visit a group in the country where they currently work. 
- A small number of places may be available for researchers working outside these countries - please contact [staff@hpc-europa.org](mailto:staff@hpc-europa.org) for more information. 

### How do I apply? 

Apply online at [http://www.hpc-europa.org ](http://www.hpc-europa.org )

The next closing date is 13th May 2021. Applicants are likely to receive the decision in late June, so visits should be planned no earlier than July, but must be complete by 30th April 2022 when the programme ends.

There will be 2 further closing dates in September and November. Applications can be submitted at any time. You should receive a decision approximately 6 weeks after the closing date.
