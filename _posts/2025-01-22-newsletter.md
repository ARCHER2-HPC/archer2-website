## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025


Following the success of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2024, we are pleased to announce that [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2025/) will take place on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. 

The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from ARCHER2 researchers and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee.

We would like to invite the ARCHER2 community to submit posters for presentation at the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025.
Posters should demonstrate your work on ARCHER2, showcasing the science outcomes and impact achieved.

## Using ARCHER2 Efficiently

Online, 28 - 30 January 2025 09:00 - 17:00 GMT 

This three day workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to understand the most optimal way to port, execute and optimize applications for ARCHER2. The workshop is a mixture of lectures and practical hands-on sessions. Example exercises will be provided but attendees are encouraged to bring their own applications.

This is an opportunity to learn about the system hardware and software architecture, direct from HPE Cray Centre of Excellence experts, and we do not expect to be able to repeat this opportunity in the near future. No recordings will be provided so we encourage you to sign up now to ensure your place.

## Data carpentry

Cardiff, 30 - 31 January 2025 09:30 - 17:00 GMT

Data Carpentry workshops will focus on introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. It is ideal training for researchers wishing to learn how to use open source tools to make their research open and reproducible. you do not need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This two-day workshop will cover:

-     Data Organization in Spreadsheets
-     Data Cleaning with OpenRefine
-     Data Analysis and Visualization in R
-     Data Management with SQL

This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset from the Portal Project Teaching Database and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualization. would use.

There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher

## Reproducible computational environments using containers: introduction to Docker and Singularity

University of Cambridge, 17 - 18 February 2025 Mon 17th 10:00 - 16:30 GMT, Tue 18th 09:00 - 14:30 GMT

This course aims to introduce the use of containers with the goal of using them to effect reproducible computational environments. Such environments are useful for ensuring reproducible research outputs and for simplifying the setup of complex software dependencies across different systems. The course will introduce the use of Docker and Singularity containers but the material will be of use for whatever container technology you plan to, or end up, using. On completion of this course attendees should:

 -   Have an understanding of what Docker/Singularity containers are, why they are useful and the common terminology used
 -   Have a working Docker installation on your local system to allow you to use containers
 -   Understand how to use existing Docker containers for common tasks
 -   Be able to build your own Docker/Singularity containers by understanding both the role of a Dockerfile/Singularity recipe in building containers, and the syntax used in Dockerfiles/Singularity recipes
 -   Understand how to manage Docker/Singularity containers on your local system
 -   Appreciate decisions that need to be made around containerising research workflows
 -   Understand the differences between Docker and Singularity containers and why Singularity is more suitable for multi-user systems (e.g. HPC)
 -   Appreciate issues around reproducibility in software, understand how containers can address some of these issues and what the limits to reproducibility using containers are
