## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science

We are pleased to announce that the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science will take place on the 7th – 8th March 2024 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh.

The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from members of the ARCHER2 research consortia and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session focusing on preparing the UK science community for future Exascale systems. All attendees are welcome to join the drink reception on the evening of the first day.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee.

## ARCHER2 User Survey 2023

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 Annual User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.<br/>
Additionally, if you enter your ARCHER2 username in the final question, then you will be **entered into the prize draw to win one of five £50 Amazon vouchers**.

[Complete the survey](https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2023)

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.



## Advanced use of LAMMPS

Online, 17 January 2024 09:30 - 16:30 GMT

This lesson provides an overview of some more advanced techniques and uses of LAMMPS. Specifically, we will be discussing:

- Measuring and improving LAMMPS performance:
  - Strong vs weak scaling for a range of systems.
  - Smarter domain decomposition.
  - Accelerators, and what they do.
- Running LAMMPS from Python.
- Analysing systems through reruns.
- Advanced sampling methods with a focus on replica exchange.

For this lesson, we expect attendees to be familiar with LAMMPS. We will not be covering how to prepare and run a parallel LAMMPS simulation (and we will assume that all attendees know how to do this already). This lesson is aimed at anyone who:

- Has experience using bash.
- Has experience running LAMMPS on multiple processors.
- Would like to learn more about some of the LAMMPS functionalities stated above.
- Would like to learn more about tricks and methods for getting LAMMPS to perform efficiently.

## HPC Carpentry

Liverpool, 18 - 19 January 2024 09:30 - 16:00 GMT

This two-day course introduces accessing remote advanced computing facilities via the command line and High Performance Computing (HPC). The first day will introduce how to use the shell in a HPC context. The second day will cover how to use HPC systems effectively. Please note that the first day is optional in case you’re already familiar with the shell.

After completing this course, participants will:

- Understand motivations for using HPC in research.
- Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops.
- Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data.
- Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems.
- Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system.
- Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software.
- Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource.
