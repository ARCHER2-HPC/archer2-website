## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025


Following the success of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2024, we are pleased to announce that [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2025/) will take place on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. 

The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from ARCHER2 researchers and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee.

We would like to invite the ARCHER2 community to submit posters for presentation at the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025.
Posters should demonstrate your work on ARCHER2, showcasing the science outcomes and impact achieved.

## Advanced OpenMP

Online, 18, 20, 25 and 27 February 2025 10:00 - 12:00 GMT

OpenMP is the industry standard for shared-memory programming, which enables serial programs to be parallelised using compiler directives.This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of OpenMP and explore some of its more recent and advanced features.

This course will cover topics including nested parallelism, OpenMP tasks, the OpenMP memory model, performance tuning, hybrid OpenMP + MPI, OpenMP implementations, and recently added features in OpenMP.

Please note that this course will not cover using OpenMP for GPU programming – this will be the main topic of an upcoming ARCHER2 course on GPU Programming with Directives.

Hands-on practical programming exercises make up a significant, and integral, part of this course.

Attendees should be familiar with the basics of OpenMP, including parallel regions, data scoping, work sharing directives and synchronisation constructs. Access will be given to appropriate hardware for all the exercises, although many of them can also be performed on a standard Linux laptop.

## GPU programming using directives

Edinburgh, 13 - 14 March 2025 09:00 - 17:00 GMT

The OpenMP offload and OpenACC APIs support portable GPU programing using directives in Fortran, C and C++. This course will provide an introduction to GPU programming with directives, aimed at scientific application programmers wishing to develop their own software. The course will give a background on GPU architecture and programming API, and then focus on using OpenMP offload directives. The course will cover offloading code and data movement, as well as more advanced topics such as interoperability with HIP and performance tuning. We will also cover the similarities and differences between OpenMP and OpenACC.

Note that although the course will use AMD GPUs for practical exercises, it is also appropriate for those wishing to use NVIDIA or Intel GPUs.

### Pre-requisite Programming Languages:

Attendees must be able to program in Fortran, C or C++ (course examples and exercises will limit themselves to Fortran and C). A familiarity with threaded programming models (especially OpenMP for CPUs) would be useful, but no previous knowledge of GPU programming is required.

## Software Carpentry

Online, 17 - 21 March 2025 09:30 - 13:00 GMT

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including:

-   Program design (Python)
-  Version control with Git
-   The Unix Shell

## GPU programming with HIP

Online, 24 - 26 March 2025 10:00 - 16:00 GMT

This three-day course will provide an introduction to GPU computing with HIP aimed at scientific application programmers wishing to develop their own software. The course will give a background on the difference between CPU and GPU architectures as a prelude to introductory exercises in HIP programming. The course will discuss the execution of kernels, memory management, among other topics.

The course will not discuss programming with compiler directives, but does provide a concrete basis of understanding of the underlying principles of the HIP model which is useful for programmers ultimately wishing to make use of OpenMP or OpenACC. The course will not consider graphics programming, nor will it consider machine learning packages.

Note that the course is also appropriate for those wishing to use NVIDIA GPUs via the CUDA API, although we will not specifically use CUDA.

Attendees must be able to program in C or C++. A familiarity with threaded programming models would be useful, but no previous knowledge of GPU programming is required.

## HPC Ready - Developing RSE and HPC skills (UNIVERSE-HPC)

Join us for a one-day workshop - “HPC Ready: Developing RSE and HPC skills” - on Thursday 27th March 2025 from 10:00 to 16:00 (GMT/UTC), which will take place in person at the University of Edinburgh Bayes Centre, and online.

Everyone is Welcome!

-	 In person at the University of Edinburgh, Bayes Centre and Online via Zoom

After three years, the UNIVERSE-HPC project is coming to a close and we will be celebrating this milestone with an event about training for RSEs, with an emphasis on HPC. Members of the wider RSE and HPC training communities will give talks on their work in this field and UNIVERSE-HPC members will share some of our achievements over the course of the project.

This will be a great opportunity to meet and network with members of the community and find out more about the work going on in the area of RSE training! 

Tea, coffee, cake, and lunch will be provided! [Please read our event privacy notice]( https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/secretariat/public/ICL---Events-privacy-notice---10-October-2018.pdf)
