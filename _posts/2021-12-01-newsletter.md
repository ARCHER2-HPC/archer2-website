## ARCHER2 User drop-in session
 
Online, 1 December 2021 14:00 - 16:00

We ran a webinar last week to introduce the ARCHER2 full system and the recording and slides from that webinar are available at <https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/211117-archer2-full-system/>

Now that users have access to the ARCHER2 full service, we will be running a drop-in session on Wednesday 1st December from 14:00-16:00, where members of the ARCHER2 support team will be on hand to answer questions about the ARCHER2 full system and transferring data from the 4-cabinet system to the full system.

Weâ€™re aware that switching to a new system can be complicated, and we will be on-hand throughout this webinar to answer questions, provide advice, and hear feedback from the ARCHER2 community about this process.

Drop in at any point during the session - it is not expected to attend the full two hours.

We are delighted to announce the return of the ARCHER2 Calendar for 2022 after we were unable to produce one last year. If you would like to receive a copy, posted right to your desk, please just fill in the [request form](https://forms.office.com/r/6Ketkyjq0m)

Copies are limited so do please sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

The calendar features images from the [ARCHER2 Image and Video competition](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/gallery/2021-image-comp/) and information about the associated work on ARCHER2 and the teams involved.




## Efficient Parallel IO on ARCHER2

Online 11 January 2022 09:30 - 17:00

One of the greatest challenges to running parallel applications on large numbers of processors is how to handle file IO. Standard Unix IO routines are not designed with parallelism in mind, and IO overheads can grow to dominate the overall runtime. Parallel file systems are optimised for large volumes of data, but performance can be far from optimal if every process opens its own file or if all IO is funnelled through a single controller process.

This hands-on course explores a range of issues related to parallel IO. It uses ARCHER2 and its parallel Lustre file system as a platform for the exercises; however, almost all the IO concepts and performance considerations are applicable to any parallel system.

## ARCHER2 for Package Users

Online  2 December 2021 10:00 - 16:00 GMT

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
- What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
- How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
- What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?

## Data Transfer of /work - a reminder
A reminder that users are responsible for transferring any required data from /work on the 4 Cabinet system to /work on the full system.
