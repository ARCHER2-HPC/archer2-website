## User Survey - ARCHER2 Evaluation Activity

UKRI has commissioned London Economics to undertake a socio-economic impact assessment of ARCHER2. The outcomes of this research will help evidence the benefits ARCHER2 brings to the academic and wider HPC community.

Your input to this study is fundamental to ensuring the study captures the importance of ARCHER2 and to help make future funding cases. We ask you take some time to complete this survey. 

[The survey is now live](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/G7D2FR/ )

This survey will be open for 5 weeks from the 16th April 2025 to the 21st May 2025.

Please do complete the survey.

## Spring 2025 UKRI Access to HPC Call open

Deadline: 22 May 2025 4:00pm UK time

[ARCHER2 access page :](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/access.html#archer2-time-calls)

[Full details of UKRI call :]( https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/access-to-high-performance-computing-facilities-spring-2025/)

### Webinar for potential applicants

UKRI will hold a webinar on 29 April 2025 from 11:00am to 12:00pm UK time. This will provide more information about the funding opportunity and a chance to ask questions.

[Register for the webinar (Teams) :]( https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/b279bba1-dbfb-4add-9c72-5c78432b690e@8bb7e08e-daa4-4a8e-927e-fca38db04b7e)


## UKRI National Federated Compute Services Network+ Flexible Funding Call 

Deadline: Noon on Friday 16th May 2025 

We are pleased to announce the opening of the Flexible Funding Call from the National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus (NFCS) team. 

We invite applications for the flexible funding call. The Flexible Funding call is designed to support projects that: (a) collect relevant evidence and documentation to contribute to the development of the federation roadmaps; (b) contribute to building the community around NFCS.

The flexible nature of the call will enable the selection of projects on various scales that span the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Community, Technology, and Governance. The selection of projects will seek to achieve a balance across these pillars and between large and small projects. The Flexible Funding call is the principal mechanism through which the community can contribute to developing the insights needed for the roadmaps, and the project selection will look to ensure that a range of communities of different sizes and maturities with respect to large-scale computing and data services are engaged.

The call documents (application form, call guidance and draft collaboration agreement) can be found at:   
[https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/nfcs/ ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/nfcs/ )

To ensure prompt delivery of funds, please spend time reviewing the Draft collaboration agreement and share with the relevant team at your institution: [Draft Collaboration Agreement  ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/nfcs/NFCS_FF_CollaborationAgreement.pdf)

Deadline for applications for the call is noon on Friday 16 May 2025.  

If you would like to be kept informed of the work of the NFCS Network+, please register for the [National Federated Compute Services Network+ mailing list ](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=NFCS-NETWORKPLUS-ANNOUNCE) 

Finally, the slides (and soon videos) from the  launch event for the NFCS are now available at: [UKRI Federated National Compute Services NetworkPlus London ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/ukri-federated-national-compute-services-networkplus/) 


## Exhibits and Engagement Activities for the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025

We are looking for exhibits and/or activities to participate in the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025 on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. These exhibits/activities will be in the main foyer area of the event and attendees will be able to engage with these throughout the event.  These exhibits may for example showcase your outreach activities aimed at the general public or showcase dissemination activities for fellow professionals. These do not need to be on a large scale, our aim is to highlight a diverse range of activities. 

If you are interested in showcasing your activities at the event please email [events@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:events@archer2.ac.uk) to discuss.

	
## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025

Following the success of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2024, we are pleased to announce that [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2025/) will take place on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. 
The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from ARCHER2 researchers and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee. Registration deadline is 29th April 2025.

## EPCC HPC Summer School 2025

Now in its third year, EPCC's HPC Summer School will offer UK undergraduate students the opportunity to learn about high performance computing in a residential and practical setting over two weeks in the summer of 2025. 

The 2025 EPCC Summer School in High Performance Computing (HPC) will include access to ARCHER2, which with over 700,000 CPU cores is the UK's largest supercomputer.

The programme will run over two weeks from June 14th - 28th with travel, accommodation and a subsistence allowance provided to successful applicants. We welcome applications from a wide range of students regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status.

Applications are open now and will close on April 28th 2025. [Find out more](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/hpc-summer-school)


## Green software use on HPC

Edinburgh, 13 May 2025 10:00 - 15:30 BST

This lesson introduces environmental sustainability principles in the context of high performance computing (HPC) systems. Understanding the scale of emissions from different sources is critical to being able to make changes to work in a more environmentally sustainable way. This lesson will give you the ability to understand emissions arising from use of HPC system and how to quantify them. We will use practical examples and real data from an existing HPC facility to illustrate the concepts. By the end of this lesson you should:

-     Be able to understand the concept of carbon efficiency and how it relates to energy efficiency including cases where energy efficiency can be at odds with carbon efficiency
-     Know about how HPC systems potentially reduce emissions
-     Understand carbon intensity of electricity generation and the implications for carbon aware use of HPC
-     Appreciate the embodied emissions associated with HPC hardware and how they impact carbon aware use of HPC
-     Be aware of the frameworks used to measure and report on carbon emissions and how the terms used in these frameworks map onto HPC
-     Gain practical advice on how you can measure and improve the carbon efficiency of your use of HPC

We use the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2 as an example throughout this lesson but the principles and learning should be applicable to any HPC system.
