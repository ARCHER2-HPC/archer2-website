## Introduction to ARCHER2 for Software Developers

Online, 19 - 20 April 2022 10:00 - 16:00 BST 
 
The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
    + What does they consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
    + How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 application development environment look like and how do I use it?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and  look at historical usage?

## ARCHER2 for Data Scientists

Online, 22 April 2022 10:00 - 17:30 BST 
 
This course covers the basics of ARCHER2 for data scientists. We will cover ARCHER2 hardware, software, and configurations, discuss how to install software and use containers on the system, and then look in more detail at how to ensure data science workflows are efficiently exploiting ARCHER2. We will cover both R and Python topics, looking at potential methods for parallelising data science workflows across the ARCHER2 hardware, and ensuring efficient use of the compute nodes ARCHER2 provides.

## High-resolution prediction of wind profile and wind turbine aerodynamics using CFD and HPC

Online webinar, Wednesday 20th April 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST

In the numerical simulation of wind farms, an adequate resolution of the incoming wind profile is necessary for an accurate prediction of the working condition of the wind turbines. At the same time, the accurate description of the aerodynamics of the wind turbines wakes is paramount to assess the energy resource available to wind turbines downstream of front-row turbines in the wind farms.

The aim of the presented project is two-fold. One aim is to use high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to resolve the full-rotor aerodynamics and the wake formation and propagation for misaligned wind conditions. These results would represent a valuable knowledge base to investigate the accuracy of modern numerical approaches used to assess turbine power production and the reliability of wake predictions, key to assess wind farm power losses due to rotor/wake interactions. The second aim is the application of high-resolution CFD for the accurate prediction of the wind field at wind farm installation sites. Here, the spatial resolution and accuracy of the wind field obtained with numerical weather prediction tools (mesoscale simulations), is enhanced by including local-scale features as resolved wind shear and waves motion.
