Final build day!

The final day of the build of our 4 cabinet system. Yesterday saw the system booted and lots of testing carried out. First job of the day was to locate some erroneous cables that were causing power to not be read properly.

Troubleshooting then identified the need for a DIMM swap and a Network Interface (NIC) swap on two of the blades.

Swapping the blades involves the use of a purpose designed lifting tool, which allows the blades to be lifted and lowered safely.

The next stage of the process is for the ARCHER2 team to test and prepare for user service, then release the system to the user community.
