## User Survey - ARCHER2 Evaluation Activity

UKRI has commissioned London Economics to undertake a socio-economic impact assessment of ARCHER2. The outcomes of this research will help evidence the benefits ARCHER2 brings to the academic and wider HPC community.

Your input to this study is fundamental to ensuring the study captures the importance of ARCHER2 and to help make future funding cases. We ask you take some time to complete this survey. 

[The survey is now live](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/G7D2FR/ )

This survey will be open for 5 weeks from the 16th April 2025 to the 21st May 2025.

Please do complete the survey.


## Spring 2025 UKRI Access to HPC Call open

Deadline: 22 May 2025 4:00pm UK time

[ARCHER2 access page :](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/access.html#archer2-time-calls)

[Full details of UKRI call :]( https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/access-to-high-performance-computing-facilities-spring-2025/)


## UKRI National Federated Compute Services Network+ Flexible Funding Call 

Deadline: Noon on Friday 16th May 2025 

We are pleased to announce the opening of the Flexible Funding Call from the National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus (NFCS) team. 

We invite applications for the flexible funding call. The Flexible Funding call is designed to support projects that: (a) collect relevant evidence and documentation to contribute to the development of the federation roadmaps; (b) contribute to building the community around NFCS.

The flexible nature of the call will enable the selection of projects on various scales that span the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Community, Technology, and Governance. The selection of projects will seek to achieve a balance across these pillars and between large and small projects. The Flexible Funding call is the principal mechanism through which the community can contribute to developing the insights needed for the roadmaps, and the project selection will look to ensure that a range of communities of different sizes and maturities with respect to large-scale computing and data services are engaged.

The call documents (application form, call guidance and draft collaboration agreement) can be found at:   
[https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/nfcs/ ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/nfcs/ )

To ensure prompt delivery of funds, please spend time reviewing the Draft collaboration agreement and share with the relevant team at your institution: [Draft Collaboration Agreement  ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/nfcs/NFCS_FF_CollaborationAgreement.pdf)

Deadline for applications for the call is noon on Friday 16 May 2025.  

If you would like to be kept informed of the work of the NFCS Network+, please register for the [National Federated Compute Services Network+ mailing list ](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=NFCS-NETWORKPLUS-ANNOUNCE) 

Finally, the slides (and soon videos) from the  launch event for the NFCS are now available at: [UKRI Federated National Compute Services NetworkPlus London ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/ukri-federated-national-compute-services-networkplus/) 


## ARCHER2 Capability Days: 17-19 June 2025

The fourth ARCHER2 Capability Days session will run from 17-19 June 2025. ARCHER2 Capability Days are a mechanism to allow users to run large scale tests on the system free of charge. The motivations behind Capability Days are:

- Enhancing world-leading science from ARCHER2 by enabling modelling and simulation at scales that are not otherwise possible.
- Enabling capability use cases that are not possible on other UK HPC services.
- Providing a facility that can be used to test scaling to help prepare software and communities for future exascale resources.

Capability Days are made up of two parts:

- 0800-2000 BST, 17 June 2025 - pre-Capability Days session (pre-capabilityday QoS) to allow users to test scaling and job setup ahead of full Capability Day
    - Supports jobs 256-1024 nodes, 20 min maximum run time
    - Jobs are uncharged
- 2000 BST, 17 June - 1400 BST, 19 June 2025 - Capability Days session (capabilityday QoS)
    - Supports jobs 512-4096 nodes, 1 hour maximum run time
    - Jobs are uncharged
