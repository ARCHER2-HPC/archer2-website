## ARCHER2 Festive Period

The ARCHER2 Service will observe the UK Public holidays and will be closed for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Yearâ€™s Day.

We fully expect the ARCHER2 service to be available during these holidays but we will not have staff on the Service Desk to deal with any queries or issues you may experience. Users will be able to connect to the system and submit jobs as usual. The Service Desk will be open as usual on all other workdays (Monday - Friday from 0800-1800) excluding these holidays.

Key Dates:

-   Wednesday 25th December - ARCHER2 Service Desk Closed
-    Thursday 26th December - ARCHER2 Service Desk Closed
-   Wednesday 1st January - ARCHER2 Service Desk Closed

As always please contact support@archer2.ac.uk if you have any questions or problems and please check the ARCHER2 Status page for updates
	

## Low priority queue over the festive break


Over the festive break, ARCHER2 may be slightly less busy than usual, so to encourage those of you able to make use of this, we have increased the limits on the Low Priority QoS so each user can have up to 32 running jobs and up to 64 pending or running (compared with current limits of 16 running, 16 pending or running).

We hope this will be beneficial to users and also help keep the machine utilisation high.

Please don't forget, though, that your awarded allocation cannot be moved forward if unused, so please try to utilise that first - but keeping enough to maintain a positive CU balance as required to access the Low Priority queue.

## Meet the ARCHER2 User Advisory Group

We have recently added a page to the website with details of members of the [ARCHER2 User Advisory Group (UAG)](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/uag/)
 
The ARCHER2 User Advisory Group represents the current and prospective user base of ARCHER2, the UK national supercomputing service. The group provides recommendations and feedback to UKRI with the aim of improving the user experience of the service. Any ARCHER2 user is able to contact UAG members if they want to provide input into the service.


## Forge license boost w/b 16th December

The Forge license will be increased from 16 nodes to 64 nodes for one week beginning 16th December. [Full details of DDT and MAP]( https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/data-tools/forge/)


## Using ARCHER2 Efficiently

Online, 28 - 30 January 2025 09:00 - 17:00 GMT 

This three day workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to understand the most optimal way to port, execute and optimize applications for ARCHER2. The workshop is a mixture of lectures and practical hands-on sessions. Example exercises will be provided but attendees are encouraged to bring their own applications.

This is an opportunity to learn about the system hardware and software architecture, direct from HPE Cray Centre of Excellence experts, and we do not expect to be able to repeat this opportunity in the near future. No recordings will be provided so we encourage you to sign up now to ensure your place.

## Data carpentry

Cardiff, 30 - 31 January 2025 09:30 - 17:00 GMT

Data Carpentry workshops will focus on introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. It is ideal training for researchers wishing to learn how to use open source tools to make their research open and reproducible. you do not need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This two-day workshop will cover:

-     Data Organization in Spreadsheets
-     Data Cleaning with OpenRefine
-     Data Analysis and Visualization in R
-     Data Management with SQL

This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset from the Portal Project Teaching Database and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualization. would use.

There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher
