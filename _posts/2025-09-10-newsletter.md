## Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) Power Outage: 09:00 Friday 29th August – 18:00 Monday 15th September

Due to a significant Health and Safety risk, associated with our power supply to the site, that requires action at the ACF, there will be a full power outage to the site from 9am Friday 29th August – 18:00 Monday 15th September.  Specialised external contractors will be working on a 24/7 basis for the outage period replacing switchgear.

### ARCHER2 User Impact

ARCHER2 will be completely powered off for the duration of this period.

Users will not be able to connect to ARCHER2 and will not be able to access data on any of the ARCHER2 file systems. The system will be drained of jobs ahead of the power outage and jobs will not run during this period. Any queued jobs will remain in the queue during the outage and jobs will start once the service is returned.

SAFE and the ARCHER2 website will be available during the outage period so users can continue to contact us and we will be providing updates during the outage on our [status page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html).

We will notify users once the service is available and we expect this to be on Monday 15th September at 18:00.

### RDFaaS, /epsrc and /general

The RDFaaS, /epsrc and /general will return to service on 19 September, allowing further work on the file system to be completed. 

### NVMe scratch file system automated deletions

Automated deletions of the NVMe scratch file system will be disabled on Friday August 22nd and re-enabled on Tuesday October 14th to ensure users are given the normal number of working days before deletion.  A reminder will be sent nearer the time.

[Paul Clark, EPCC’s Director of HPC Systems, provided an update on progress in a blog at the end of the first week of work.](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/news/2025/09/05/acf-shut-down-update.html)

We apologise for the inconvenience of this essential outage. Please contact [support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any questions.

## Green software use on HPC

Birmingham, 22 October 2025 10:00 - 15:30 BST

This lesson introduces environmental sustainability principles in the context of high performance computing (HPC) systems. Understanding the scale of emissions from different sources is critical to being able to make changes to work in a more environmentally sustainable way. This lesson will give you the ability to understand emissions arising from use of HPC system and how to quantify them. We will use practical examples and real data from an existing HPC facility to illustrate the concepts. By the end of this lesson you should:

-   Be able to understand the concept of carbon efficiency and how it relates to energy efficiency including cases where energy efficiency can be at odds with carbon efficiency
-   Know about how HPC systems potentially reduce emissions
-   Understand carbon intensity of electricity generation and the implications for carbon aware use of HPC
-   Appreciate the embodied emissions associated with HPC hardware and how they impact carbon aware use of HPC
-   Be aware of the frameworks used to measure and report on carbon emissions and how the terms used in these frameworks map onto HPC
-    Gain practical advice on how you can measure and improve the carbon efficiency of your use of HPC

We use the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2 as an example throughout this lesson but the principles and learning should be applicable to any HPC system.
Target Audience:

This lesson is aimed at all stakeholders in HPC use (e.g. researchers, RSEs, funders). No knowledge of environmental sustainability principles is assumed.

## National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus 
### Autumn Conference : Edinburgh, Monday 22nd and Tuesday 23rd September 

The National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus aims to build collaboration and knowledge exchange for federating across the stakeholder communities that use and provide computational services. A key objective is to produce a roadmap for the future of federated compute services in the UK.

Please join us at the autumn conference in Edinburgh on Monday 22nd and Tuesday 23rd September. 
[Registration]( https://indico.ph.qmul.ac.uk/event/2299/overview )

Further details regarding the 2nd flexible funding call will be available at the meeting including a mini-sandpit. 


## NetDRIVE Second Call for Community Projects and Champions 

The NetDRIVE 2nd call for community projects has been published, offering over £1m for activities contributing towards sustainable research computing for UKRI: 
-	[Guidance and application forms]( https://eng.ox.ac.uk/netdrive/netdrive-calls/second-funding-call/ ) 
-	The total budget for community projects will be £1m (100% FEC, with projects being awarded 80% FEC). 
-	The 2nd call will have two components: around 20% of funds will be reserved for projects led by early career applicants (submissions of full proposals close October 24th , but applications to join a sandpit event should be submitted by September 10th) and the remainder will be open to all (submissions close October 10th). 
-	There is also funding in this call for 3 champions with social science qualifications, with two of these positions reserved for early career applicants.   


## Monitoring jobs

We provide advice on how to [monitor running jobs]( 
https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/scheduler/#squeue-monitoring-jobs)

In particular, we would remind users that the `watch` command can cause heavy load on the slurm system, impacting all users of ARCHER2.   If it is essential to poll slurm in this way, please ensure that you set a time period of 60 seconds or longer.
