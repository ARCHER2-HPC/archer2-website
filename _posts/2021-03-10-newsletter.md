## Exploding, forming and disentangling stars with HPC

Online webinar, Wednesday 10th March 2021 15:00 - 16:00 BST 

High-performance computation (HPC) is central to modern astronomy. Moreover, the diversity of astronomy as a science results in models with very different computational requirements.

In this presentation, I will show-case three representative astrophysical problems which strongly rely on HPC in different ways. These include the models of how mergers of white dwarf stars may lead to type 1a supernovae, which are among the brightest explosions in the universe; simulations of binary stars with a detailed stellar evolution code, which demonstrate how these stars trace the history of our Galaxy; and finally, the evolution of triple stars, for which using correct models of stellar interactions make a substantial effect on their present-day orbits.

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.

## Access to HPC call open

The Access to High Performance Computing Call, through which EPSRC users can access the council's new and upcoming Tier-1 and Tier-2 resources has now gone live:
[https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/access-to-high-performance-computing/](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/access-to-high-performance-computing/)

[https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/access.html](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/access.html)

This call is the successor to the ARCHER RAP and Tier-2 Open Access calls processes, through which users were previously able to access each of EPSRC's HPC resources.

Closing date: 30 April 2021 16:00
Closing date for Technial assessment: 2 April 2021


## HPC TopUp call open

The HPC TopUp Call, through which existing EPSRC users with an existing ARCHER2 allocation who require additional resource can apply.

## Introduction to ARCHER2 for software developers

Online, 29 - 30 March 2021 10:00 - 16:00 

### Overview:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
   - What does they consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
   - How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 application development environment look like and how do I use it?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?

### Target Audience:

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for user who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to compile (and possibly) develop HPC software on ARCHER2.
