Computing Insights UK 2022 was the first conference I attended ever since I began my journey in HPC. It took place in Manchester with the main  theme being "Sustainable HPC".

During my two days there I was able to speak to some great professionalists and like-minded people. I have learned many new things from the interesting talks that were part of the programme. From how to optimise HPC workflows to the very impressive talk by our colleague Michele Weiland about Net Zero HPC.

Later on I attended a meetup with fellow HPC sysadmins and research infrastructure engineers to talk about common interests, experiences and exchange
knowledge about workload schedulers like Slurm. Thanks to that, I realized how much bigger and more connected the HPC community is which made me feel great.

As a result I signed up for the HPC Sig mailing list and Slack channels for further chats with specialists in the industry. It has been an incredible experience and I cannot thank my colleagues enough for making it possible.

The HPC community is thriving and being part of it has never been more exciting!
