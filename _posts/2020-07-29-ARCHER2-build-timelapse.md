On the 14th July 2020 the first four cabinets of ARCHER2 arrived at the ACF and over the following few days they were unpacked, moved into position, connected up and ultimately powered up ready to go.

Gregor Muir was on hand, capturing the whole process in still images and timelapse recording.

Enjoy this short video which takes you through the whole process, from opening the delivery trucks to the new machine up and running.
