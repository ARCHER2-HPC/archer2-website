## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) and Early Career eCSE Panel Observers calls


### ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call


We are very pleased to announce that the 5th ARCHER2 eCSE call (ARCHER2 eCSE05) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation is 16:00 on 5 October 2021 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 26 October 2021.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on theARCHER2 system. For this call software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC is eligible. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of the 
above. Proposals may request effort from between 1 and 12 person months (inclusive).

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/>

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.

### ARCHER2 Early Career eCSE Panel Observers call


The eCSE Panel Meeting is the meeting where eCSE proposals are reviewed and decisions are made on which proposals to fund. As part of our commitment to encouraging and developing Early Career Researchers, we are offering a small number of places to such researchers to attend the 
eCSE panel meeting as Early Career Observers. The aim is to give Early Career Researchers a better insight into this competitive selection process, to assist them in the preparation of future funding proposals.

The deadline for applying to attend the panel meeting as an observer is 16:00 on 5 Oct 2021 and details of the call are given here: 

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/observers/>

### eCSE call dates


- Deadline for submitting eCSE05 documents for technical evaluation: 16:00 
on Tuesday 5 October 2021
- Deadline for applications to the observer call: 16:00 on Tuesday 5 October 2021
- Deadline for final eCSE05 submission: 16:00 Tuesday 26 October 2021

## Advanced OpenMP

Online - 5 and 8 October 2021 09:00 - 17:00 GMT

OpenMP is the industry standard for shared-memory programming, which enables serial programs to be parallelised using compiler directives.This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of OpenMP and explore some of its more recent and advanced features.

This course will cover topics including nested parallelism, OpenMP tasks, the OpenMP memory model, performance tuning, hybrid OpenMP + MPI, OpenMP implementations, and recently added features in OpenMP.

Hands-on practical programming exercises make up a significant, and integral, part of this course.

Attendees should be familiar with the basics of OpenMP, including parallel regions, data scoping, work sharing directives and synchronisation constructs. Access will be given to appropriate hardware for all the exercises, although many of them can also be performed on a standard Linux laptop.

## ARCHER2 for Software Developers

Online 	18 - 19 October 2021 10:00 - 16:00 BST 

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
   - What does they consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
   - How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 application development environment look like and how do I use it?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?

**Target Audience:**

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for user who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to compile (and possibly) develop HPC software on ARCHER2.

**Prerequisites:**

You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line. You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using scp). Finally, you should be comfortable with compiling parallel HPC source code that uses MPI and OpenMP.
