## Exhibits and Engagement Activities for the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025

We are looking for exhibits and/or activities to participate in the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025 on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. These exhibits/activities will be in the main foyer area of the event and attendees will be able to engage with these throughout the event.  These exhibits may for example showcase your outreach activities aimed at the general public or showcase dissemination activities for fellow professionals. These do not need to be on a large scale, our aim is to highlight a diverse range of activities. 

If you are interested in showcasing your activities at the event please email [events@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:events@archer2.ac.uk) to discuss.

	
## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025 - Poster Abstract Submission extended Friday 28 March 

Following the success of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2024, we are pleased to announce that [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2025/) will take place on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. 
The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from ARCHER2 researchers and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee.

We would like to invite the ARCHER2 community to submit posters for presentation at the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025.
Posters should demonstrate your work on ARCHER2, showcasing the science outcomes and impact achieved. Please complete the Poster Abstract Submission Form and email it to events@archer2.ac.uk by Friday 21st March 2025.

## SSI Research Software Maintenance Call

The [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/) is excited to announce a new funding initiative: the [Research Software Maintenance Fund (RSMF)]( https://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-maintenance-fund).

This fund offers £4.8 million to support existing research software, improve how research software is maintained, and reduce technical debt—ensuring essential tools remain available to the research community.

This initiative is part of the [SSI’s fourth phase](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/record-ps102m-investment-continue-improving-research-software-practices) and is supported through the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) programme.


## The Science behind the Image Competition - 3

Wednesday 26th March 14:00 - 15:00 

In this webinar, there will be a series of lightening talks from the creators of some of the images from the [2024 ARCHER2 Image and Video Competition](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/gallery/2024-image-comp/)

## Modern C++ for Computational Scientists

Durham, 23 - 24 April 2025 09:30 - 16:00

With the recent revisions to the C++ language and standard library, the ways it is now being used are quite different. Used well, these features enable the programmer to write elegant, reusable and portable code that runs efficiently on a variety of architectures.

However it is still a very large and complex tool. This course will cover a minimal set of features to allow an experienced non-C++ programmer to get to grips with language.

These include:

-     overloading
-     templates
-     containers
-     iterators
-     lambdas
-     standard algorithms

We will also briefly cover some important libraries for numerical computing.

## Green software use on HPC

Edinburgh, 13 May 2025 10:00 - 15:30 BST

This lesson introduces environmental sustainability principles in the context of high performance computing (HPC) systems. Understanding the scale of emissions from different sources is critical to being able to make changes to work in a more environmentally sustainable way. This lesson will give you the ability to understand emissions arising from use of HPC system and how to quantify them. We will use practical examples and real data from an existing HPC facility to illustrate the concepts. By the end of this lesson you should:

-     Be able to understand the concept of carbon efficiency and how it relates to energy efficiency including cases where energy efficiency can be at odds with carbon efficiency
-     Know about how HPC systems potentially reduce emissions
-     Understand carbon intensity of electricity generation and the implications for carbon aware use of HPC
-     Appreciate the embodied emissions associated with HPC hardware and how they impact carbon aware use of HPC
-     Be aware of the frameworks used to measure and report on carbon emissions and how the terms used in these frameworks map onto HPC
-     Gain practical advice on how you can measure and improve the carbon efficiency of your use of HPC

We use the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2 as an example throughout this lesson but the principles and learning should be applicable to any HPC system.

## AMD MI300 Series Hackathon : Registration deadline 31 March 2025

Edinburgh, 27 - 29 May 2025 10:00 - 16:00 BST

ARCHER2 and AMD are hosting a three-day in-person hackathon to explore the potential of AMD GPUs for research. The event will focus on porting and optimizing code using the latest AMD development suite. This event is ideal for both expert practitioners and less experienced users who want to convert CPU-focused codes into efficient GPU-ready applications, and enhance the performance of current GPU-based codes using AMD’s next-gen MI300x GPU cards or the new MI300A APU superchip.

We're looking for teams of 2-5 members. Participants will work with AMD experts and have access to AMD resources. In-house experts from the ARCHER2 team are also on hand.

Deadline for applications is on 31st March 2025.
[Full details and registration](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/250527-amd-hackathon/)
Limited spaces: Applications will be reviewed as received, so early submission increases your chances.
