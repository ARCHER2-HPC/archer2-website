## HPE Cray Programming Environment Version 21.03

A new version of the HPE Cray Programming Environment (Version 21.03) has been added to ARCHER2. The HPE Cray Programming Environment packages up a suite of development tools, including compilers, libraries and utilities, designed to make it easier to develop applications on ARCHER2.

Version 21.03 includes patches for several MPI memory-management issues which have affected a number of ARCHER2 users, plus various other application-specific fixes and improvements. Version 21.03 is also expected to be the default programming environment when the full ARCHER2 service is launched.

HPE Cray Programming Environment Version 20.10 remains the default on ARCHER2. Unless users actively select the new environment, they will see the same environment as before.

Instructions on how to enable the new programming environment are available on the ARCHER2 documentation site [https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/dev-environment/](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/dev-environment).

However, we have noted that this work has caused HPE Cray perftools modules to no longer be available by default. We have provided a workaround for users while we continue to investigate these issues. Details can be found at:
[https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/known-issues/#hpe-cray-perftools-modules-not-available-by-default-added-2021-04-27](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/known-issues/#hpe-cray-perftools-modules-not-available-by-default-added-2021-04-27)


As always, users are encouraged to contact the [ARCHER2 Service Desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if they have any questions or comments.

 
## HPC TopUp call closing

The HPC TopUp Call, through which existing EPSRC users with an existing ARCHER2 allocation who require additional resource can apply.

[https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/access.html#open-archer2-calls](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/access.html#open-archer2-calls)

- Closing date 21 May 2021 16:00

- Closing date for Technical assessment: 30 April 2021 16:00
- Technical Assessments must be submitted by the deadline of 4pm on Friday 30 April - in line with UKRI guidance we are unable to accept late submissions.


## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call

We are very pleased to announce that the 4th ARCHER2 eCSE call (ARCHER2
eCSE04) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluations is 16:00 on 18 May 2021 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 8 Jun 2021.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on the
ARCHER2 system. For this call software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC or NERC is eligible.

For the first three ARCHER2 eCSE calls the programme has awarded projects of between 3 and 12 person months (inclusive). We recognise that in some cases there may be a need for work requiring less effort than this so we are now accepting proposals requesting effort from between 1 and 12 person months (inclusive). The process of submission is the same for all proposals. However, we recognise that the number of objectives and the way in which impacts and benefits will be realised may differ depending on the length of the project. This is all explained in the guidance for the call.

We are very keen to encourage software developers at the early stage of their careers. At this stage, an RSE will be developing expertise. This will be taken into account when a proposal is assessed and in such cases, the Panel will be looking at what support is on offer from PI and any Co-Is. Again, this is all explained in the guidance for the call.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

[https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/)

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc. Please note that the process for applying for an eCSE project under ARCHER2 has been updated since the ARCHER eCSE programme. More details available via the above link.

The 4th ARCHER2 eCSE call (eCSE04) opened on: Tuesday 20 April 2020

Deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation: 16:00 on Tuesday 18 May 2021

Deadline for final submission: 16:00 Tuesday 8 Jun 2021

A recent webinar can be found here:
[https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/210203-ecse-webinar/](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/210203-ecse-webinar/)
which includes a walk through of the submission of a proposal.


## RDFaaS available from ARCHER2

The RDF data is now available on RDF as a Service (RDFaaS).  
ARCHER2 users can access the data from the ARCHER2 User Access Nodes (UANs) using 

`cd /epsrc/your_project_code ` <br />
`cd /general/your_project_code `

The data is currently read-only so you are able to access the data and make a copy if needed but you are not able to write to the space during the ARCHER2 4Cabinet service. 

**Note**: as previously notified, `/nerc` is no longer available

If the data you wish to access is from an old ARCHER project which is not on ARCHER2, then please contact the Service Desk ([support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)) and we can make arrangements so that you are able to access the data.  


## HPC-Europa3 Transnational Access visitor programme 

Call for applications: next closing date 13th May 2021. 

HPC-Europa3 funds collaborative research visits for computational scientists in any discipline which can use High Performance Computing (HPC). Visits can be made to research institutes in Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or the UK. UK-based researchers can benefit in two ways: either by visiting a research group elsewhere in Europe, or by hosting a research visitor from another country. 

### What does HPC-Europa3 provide? 

- Funding for travel, living and accommodation expenses for visits of up to 13 weeks. 
- Access to world-class High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. 
- Technical support to help you make best use of the HPC systems. 
- Collaborative environment with an expert in your field of research. 

### Who can apply? 

- Researchers of all levels, from postgraduate to full professors. 
- Researchers from academia or industry. 
- Researchers currently working in a European Union country or Associated State (see [http://bit.ly/AssociatedStates](http://bit.ly/AssociatedStates) for full list of Associated States). 
- Researchers may not visit a group in the country where they currently work. 
- A small number of places may be available for researchers working outside these countries - please contact [staff@hpc-europa.org](mailto:staff@hpc-europa.org) for more information. 

### How do I apply? 

Apply online at [http://www.hpc-europa.org ](http://www.hpc-europa.org )

The next closing date is 13th May 2021. Applicants are likely to receive the decision in late June, so visits should be planned no earlier than July, but must be complete by 30th April 2022 when the programme ends.

There will be 2 further closing dates in September and November. Applications can be submitted at any time. You should receive a decision approximately 6 weeks after the closing date.
