## Advanced OpenMP

Online, 23 - 24 January 2024 09:00 - 17:00 GMT

OpenMP is the industry standard for shared-memory programming, which enables serial programs to be parallelised using compiler directives.This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of OpenMP and explore some of its more recent and advanced features.

This course will cover topics including nested parallelism, OpenMP tasks, the OpenMP memory model, performance tuning, hybrid OpenMP + MPI, OpenMP implementations, and recently added features in OpenMP.

Hands-on practical programming exercises make up a significant, and integral, part of this course.

Attendees should be familiar with the basics of OpenMP, including parallel regions, data scoping, work sharing directives and synchronisation constructs. Access will be given to appropriate hardware for all the exercises, although many of them can also be performed on a standard Linux laptop.

## Upcoming change to SAFE Institutional login

If you use the [Institutional login](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/safe-for-users/#how-to-use-institutional-login) feature in the SAFE you will be familiar with the page that allows you to select which organisation you would like to sign in with. This page (hosted on on wayf.federation.org.uk) is being retired and the SAFE will soon switch to using a local page on safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk that will provide similar functionality. 

If you find that you are no longer able to locate your organisation (or have any other problems) after this change please [contact the service desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk), so that we can investigate.
