### What are we looking for?

The ARCHER2 Image and Video Competition is an event for all users of ARCHER2 to share their images or videos of "ARCHER2 Enabling Research"

We are looking for entries that will demonstrate the contribution of ARCHER2 to research.

Entries might include (but are not limited to):

-    images generated from calculations that used ARCHER2
-    photographs of equipment and/or researchers working on projects which use ARCHER2 for computation
-    images generated from data processed using ARCHER2
-    images demonstrating the contribution of ARCHER2 to research
-    videos or animations generated from data processed using ARCHER2
-    images or videos showing the impact of research carried out on ARCHER2
-    infographic (still, video, cartoon, diagram) showing how ARCHER2 has contributed to your research or knowledge, or how it is part of your research process

Images don't need to have been generated in the last few months - any images from any time in the ARCHER2 services, including photos relating to your work, and images or videos that have been post-processed.

Take a look at the gallery of some of the [entries from 2023](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/gallery/2023-image-comp/)
