## Power draw of software on ARCHER2

In [this blog post](../..//news/2022/10/10/ARCHER2CodePowerRSE.html) we have used a month of job data from ARCHER2 and looked at the distribution of power draw for different research areas and software on ARCHER2. There is a lot of interest in power draw and energy use on large scale HPC systems such as ARCHER2 at the moment and this data was produced as part of the ongoing work ARCHER2 are doing with the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Net Zero Scoping project.



## ARCHER2 for Package Users 	

Online 	24 November 2022 10:00 - 16:00 GMT 

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
- What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
- How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
- What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?
