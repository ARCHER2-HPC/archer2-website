EPCC provides world-class supercomputing and data facilities and services for science and business. We are a leading centre in the field, renowned globally for research, innovation and teaching excellence. EPCC has three key foundations: the hosting, provision and management of high performance computing (HPC) and data facilities for academia and business; research and project support to optimise the computing activities of those organisations; and a unique project-based applications group that provides bespoke novel and high performance software solutions to academia, industry and commerce.

With respect to the provision of HPC and data facilities, EPCC runs the UK National HPC System for Academia, [ARCHER2](www.archer2.ac.uk) and a Tier-2 system called [Cirrus](www.cirrus.ac.uk) both of which have dedicated time available for Industrial use. ARCHER2 is an HPE Cray EX supercomputing system with an estimated peak performance of 28 PFLOP/s. The machine has 5,860 compute nodes, each with dual AMD EPYCTM 7742 64 core CPUs at 2.2GHz, giving 748,544 cores in total. The Cirrus facility is based around a 280 node HPE/SGI 8600 HPC system with a DDN Lustre file system and was recently upgraded via a £3.5M funding award from EPSRC which included the addition of 144 NVIDIA V100 GPUs to the system and a 1.5 PB  high performance storage layer for the most demanding data streaming applications and provides a key resource for users to explore programming frameworks and accelerated versions of existing applications in addition to supporting the exponential growth in AI and ML data science projects.

Both ARCHER2 &amp; Cirrus are available for Industry use on a pay-per-use basis and both are regularly used to solve CFD and FEA simulation and modelling problems in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, energy, oil and gas, general engineering, life sciences and financial services.  Through a simple internet connection, you can achieve cost-effective access to these systems and run your own codes as well as accessing a range of commercial software tools.
