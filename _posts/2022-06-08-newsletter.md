## Modelling Cake Formation in a Centrifugal Filter using the Discrete Element Method on ARCHER2

Online webinar, Wednesday 15th June 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST
 
In this webinar the presenter will discuss a widely-applied downstream operation from the bio/chemical industry, describing the challenges in modelling this particular operation and potential improvements using the discrete element method in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics. The presenter will describe the methodology used to model the system in detail, simplifications, the computational efficiency of such computations on HPC and how HPC-Europa3 mobility enabled improvements to this doctoral research.

## ARCHER2 Annual User Survey 2021-22

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 Annual User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.

We are also offering 5 prizes of 2000 CUs on ARCHER2 for users who complete the survey. Winners can choose to forgo the CU prize and for each winner that does this we will donate a further £20 to [Save The Children](www.savethechildren.org.uk). Winners will be drawn at random from all respondents who have left contact details after the closing date of Thursday 30th June 2022 and the winners notified by e-mail. The prizes are only available to people with existing ARCHER2 user accounts.

You can find the survey at:

 <https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2021-2022>

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.


## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call

The eCSE programme funds RSEs and PDRAs to develop software for the ARCHER2 service. Calls are issued regularly and information can be found in our [recent webinars](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220428-ecse-webinar/)  and [tutorial](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220510-ecse-tutorial/ ).

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/>

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.
