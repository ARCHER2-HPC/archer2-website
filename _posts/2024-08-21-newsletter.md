## Centrally supported software refresh

The CSE team is refreshing the catalogue of centrally supported software, based on user feedback and usage. The following changes are being made during August:
- ADIOS Version 2 is being installed, replacing ADIOS Version 1
- Blender is being added
- Likwid is being added 
- PyTorch has recently been added (w/ support for the GPU Development System)
- ARPACK, GLM, Matio and Trilinos are being removed.

We are also updating some existing centrally support software with the following new versions:
- CP2K Version 2024.01
- GROMACS Version 2022.4 for the GPU Development System
- FHI-aims Version 231212_1
- LAMMPS Version 2Aug2024 for the GPU Development System
- VASP 6.4.3
- MKL Version 2023.0.0
- PETSc Version 3.21
- SuperLU Version 6.01

These changes are being made during August. For more information please see the [ARCHER2 documentation](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide) or contact the [ARCHER2 Service Desk](mailto: support@archer2.ac.uk).



## UKRI are advertising for new members of the ARCHER2 User Advisory Group

[Please follow this link for more details on how to apply](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/work-for-us/join-an-advisory-committee-panel-or-network/academic-research-computing-high-end-resource-archer2-user-advisory-group-vacancies/)


## The 2nd GPU eCSE software development call 

GPU eCSE support provides funding to the UKRI research community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on GPU-based architectures. We invite proposals to develop software that facilitates research targeted at UKRI’s digital research infrastructure e.g. future Exascale supercomputing services, UK national AI services, national Tier-2 HPC services. The call is open to research across all of UKRI’s remit. 

The 2nd GPU eCSE call (GPU-eCSE02) opened on the 2 July 2024. The final deadline for proposal submission is 16:00 on 17 September 2024 via the ARCHER2 SAFE. Please note that for this call there is no separate technical evaluation stage or separate technical evaluation form. Funding will enable the employment of an RSE (a Research Software Engineer, PDRA or equivalent) to work specifically on the relevant software to enable new features or improve the performance of the software to be run on GPU-based architectures. Funding can be requested for up to 24 person months of effort per project for a duration of up to 2 calendar years. There is flexibility in the way the effort is requested. For example, a project may have more than one person working on it or the effort could be spread over a greater number of calendar months, i.e. a staff member could work on the project at less than 100% alongside other commitments or it could be worked on by a staff member who doesn’t work full time. Please just get in contact with the ARCHER2 Service Desk (support@archer2.ac.uk) if you wish to discuss possible scenarios. Projects are expected to start between 1 January and 1 July 2025, and be completed by 31 March 2027. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the ARCHER2 centralised CSE support team at EPCC or a mixture of the above.

Projects may utilise the GPU component of ARCHER2 or other suitable GPU resources to complete the technical work. If the proposal plans to use the GPU component of ARCHER2, successful projects will be given access to these resources. If projects plan to utilise other systems, you should ensure you have suitable resources available to complete the project successfully. Please contact and arrange this access with the relevant service provider before submission.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the [eCSE calls page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/calls/)

Deadline for final GPU-eCSE02 submission: 16:00 on 17 Sep 2024 (via the [ARCHER2 SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/))
