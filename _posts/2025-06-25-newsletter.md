## ARCHER2 User Survey 2025

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.
Additionally, if you enter your ARCHER2 username in the final question, then you will be entered into the prize draw to win one of five £50 Amazon vouchers.

[Complete the survey]( https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2025)

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.


## Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) Power Outage: Friday 29th August - Monday 15th September

Due to a significant Health and Safety risk, associated with our power supply to the site, that requires action at the ACF, there will be a full power outage to the site from Friday 29th August - Monday 15th September.  Specialised external contractors will be working on a 24/7 basis for the outage period replacing switchgear.

### ARCHER2 User Impact

ARCHER2 will be completely powered off for the duration of this period.

Users will not be able to connect to ARCHER2 and will not be able to access data on any of the ARCHER2 file systems. The system will be drained of jobs ahead of the power outage and jobs will not run during this period. Any queued jobs will remain in the queue during the outage and jobs will start once the service is returned.

SAFE and the ARCHER2 website will be available during the outage period so users can continue to contact us and we will be providing updates during the outage on the[ Status page]( https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html).

We will notify users once the service is available and we expect this to be on Monday 15th September.

We apologise for the inconvenience of this essential outage. Please contact [support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any questions.


## Modern C++ for Computational Scientists

York, 2 - 3 July 2025 09:30 - 17:00

With the recent revisions to the C++ language and standard library, the ways it is now being used are quite different. Used well, these features enable the programmer to write elegant, reusable and portable code that runs efficiently on a variety of architectures.

However it is still a very large and complex tool. This course will cover a minimal set of features to allow an experienced non-C++ programmer to get to grips with language.

These include:

 -   overloading
 -   templates
 -   containers
 -   iterators
 -   lambdas
 -   standard algorithms

We will also briefly cover some important libraries for numerical computing.

## "Performance portability on novel energy efficient architectures: Feasible or fantasy?"  

CONTINENTS webinar 26th of June at 16:00

The International Collaboration Towards Net Zero Computational Modelling and Simulation (CONTINENTS), is hosting its next webinar on Thursday the 26th of June at 16h UK time, which will be delivered by Nick Brown (EPCC, The University of Edinburgh), with the title: "Performance portability on novel energy efficient architectures: Feasible or fantasy?".

[The abstract, further details, and calendar invite can be found on our website]( https://continents-project.github.io/)

There is no registration needed, please re-share this event with your contacts.


## CLUSTER'25 opportunities for students  

The IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing will be hosted in Edinburgh, September 2-5 2025.
There are still many opportunities for the students to get involved, whether you are interested in applying or know someone who may be - please share the news!
The applications are now open for the:
- Student travel awards (USA & UK) - extended deadline July 7
- Mentoring program - deadline August 4
The goal of the UK travel grant is to allow the UK-based students who do not have contributions in the conference to still experience all of its offerings. Therefore, only UK students who do not have accepted submissions (paper or poster) are eligible for the IEEE travel award. 

[More information about the conference and the student program](  https://clustercomp.org/2025/mentoring/)
