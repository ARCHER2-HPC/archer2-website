## A CFD tool for the simulation of renewable energy devices using GPU accelerated hardware

Online webinar, Wednesday 25th May 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST 

Bonaventura Tagliafierro, University of Salerno

Dr. Madjid Karimirad (Queen’s University Belfast, UK) and I are carrying out a research project that will contribute to the improvement of design guidelines for the numerical modelling of offshore moored structures to produce renewable energy. We have been simulating an emblematic structure, a tension-leg platform (TLP) wind turbine. The paper proposes the results of the numerical testing campaign that has been performed to validate the numerical model as designed with the open-source DualSPHysics code. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver implementation that is used to simulate the TLP wind turbine comprises a highly parallelized structure that can leverage the high number of CUDA cores that are embedded in Nvidia GPU cards. The validation campaign is designed with this feature in mind since the allocated resources comprised the use of GPU-accelerated computing nodes available in Cirrus UK National Tier-2 HPC Service at EPCC (36 nodes × 4 NVIDIA V100s (16 GB RAM)).

## ARCHER2 Annual User Survey 2021-22

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 Annual User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.

We are also offering 5 prizes of 2000 CUs on ARCHER2 for users who complete the survey. Winners can choose to forgo the CU prize and for each winner that does this we will donate a further £20 to [Save The Children](www.savethechildren.org.uk). Winners will be drawn at random from all respondents who have left contact details after the closing date of Thursday 30th June 2022 and the winners notified by e-mail. The prizes are only available to people with existing ARCHER2 user accounts.

You can find the survey at:

 <https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2021-2022>

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.


## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call

The eCSE programme funds RSEs and PDRAs to develop software for the ARCHER2 service. Calls are issued regularly and information can be found in our [recent webinars](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220428-ecse-webinar/)  and [tutorial](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220510-ecse-tutorial/ ).

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/>

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.
