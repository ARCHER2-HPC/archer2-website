## ARCHER2 for Package Users 	

Online 	13 October 2022 10:00 - 16:00 BST 

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
- What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
- How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
- What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?
