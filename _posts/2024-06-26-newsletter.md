## Advanced MPI, Online, 27-28 June 2024

Have you ever wondered what happens inside the MPI library when you send a message? Or, whether you can exploit the fact that two processes are running on the same node to optimise communications or save memory? These issues and more will be addressed in the upcoming ARCHER2 course "Advanced MPI" running online on 27-28 June. The course also provides the opportunity to discuss your questions on MPI topics and get advice for implementing and improving the use of MPI in your software from MPI experts.

For more details and to register, see:

## Pre-announcement of the 2nd GPU eCSE call

GPU eCSE support provides funding to the UKRI research community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on GPU-based architectures. The 2nd GPU eCSE call (GPU-eCSE02) will open on Tuesday 2 July 2024. The final deadline for proposal submission is 16:00 on 17 September 2024 via the ARCHER2 SAFE. Proposals will be invited to develop software that facilitates research targeted at UKRI’s digital research infrastructure e.g. future Exascale supercomputing services, UK national AI services, national Tier-2 HPC services. The call will be open to research across all of UKRI’s remit. Funding can be requested for up to 24 person months of effort per project for a duration of up to 2 calendar years. 


## 2024 Educational Award For Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education

The ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter is seeking nominations for candidates for the 2024 Educational Award For Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education. We are seeking candidates who have led projects or programs that have made significant contributions to computational science education defined broadly to include all disciplines and all education levels.

The award will be presented at SC24. The recipient will receive a $2,000 cash award and travel support to attend the SC24 conference. Nominations will include a statement endorsing the nominee, and up to three letters of endorsement. Applications are due by Friday June 28, 2024, by end of day anywhere on earth.
