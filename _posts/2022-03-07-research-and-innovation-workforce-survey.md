All ARCHER2 users are encouraged to take part in the first UK wide Research and Innovation (R&I) Workforce Survey which is currently open for submissions (see below).

--------

## The first UK wide survey of the Research and Innovation workforce:

You are invited to take part in the first UK wide Research and Innovation (R&I) Workforce Survey. 

Ipsos, an independent research organisation, along with the University of Warwick’s Institute for Employment Research, are running the survey on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS).

This is your chance to help develop an evidence base that will inform UK government and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) policies and funding decisions. The survey covers the full range of occupations in the R&I workforce, including but not limited to trainee or experienced researchers, technicians, engineers, social and economic researchers, R&I leaders and managers.
