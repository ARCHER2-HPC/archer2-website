## Certificate renewal maintenance

Tuesday March 10th from 0800 to midnight

ARCHER2 will be unavailable from 8am on Tuesday 10th March to allow for a Certificate update.

Service will be restored as soon as possible, and certainly before midnight.  Users will be notified as soon as the service is restored.


## ARCHER2 Capability Days: 3-5 March 2026


The sixth ARCHER2 Capability Days session will run from 3-5 March 2026. ARCHER2 Capability Days are a mechanism to allow users to run large scale tests on the system free of charge. The motivations behind Capability Days are:

-	Enhancing world-leading science from ARCHER2 by enabling modelling and simulation at scales that are not otherwise possible.
-	Enabling capability use cases that are not possible on other UK HPC services.
-	Providing a facility that can be used to test scaling to help prepare software and communities for future large-scale resources.

Capability Days are made up of two parts:

-	0900-1900 GMT, 3 March 2026- **pre-Capability Days** session ("pre-capabilityday" QoS) to allow users to test scaling and job setup ahead of full Capability Day
    +	Supports jobs 256-1024 nodes, 1 hour maximum run time
    +	Jobs are uncharged
-	0800 GMT, 4 March - 1400 GMT, 5 March 2026 - **Capability Days** session (“capabilityday" QoS)
    +	Supports jobs 512-4096 nodes, 3 hours maximum run time
    +	Jobs are uncharged

[More information on how to submit jobs to these sessions can be found in the ARCHER2 documentation](

## Championing Green Digital Research Workshop - Day 0 of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2026

We are pleased to let you know the Championing Green Digital Research Workshop will take place at Sydney Smith - Doorway 1, Medical School, Teviot Place, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, on Wednesday 18 March 2026, as the Day 0 of the [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2026.]({{ page.url }}#archer2-celebration-of-science-2026)

The majority of people involved in research using digital research infrastructure (DRI) want to understand and reduce the emissions associated with their research activities to have a positive impact on the path to net zero emissions from research. The term DRI includes a very broad range of infrastructure from personal devices (smartphones, laptops, etc.), through high end servers (HPC and HTC systems) to commercial cloud computing resources. Although most people want to take action, they are hampered by a lack of understanding of the scale and source of DRI emissions, uncertain on what they can do in their day-to-day work, and find it difficult when challenged by colleagues or acquaintances who may be sceptical about taking action. This workshop will provide insight into and expand on recent efforts to understand what skills are needed to empower researchers and other digital research technical professionals to make and advocate for positive impact in using DRI for research.

Registration is open now. **Travel support application is extended to 19 February 2026.**

## Introduction to Modern Fortran

Online 	2 - 4 March 2026 10:00 - 16:00 GMT 

This course is aimed at users and developers who know how to program, but have little or no experience in Fortran, and those who may wish to have a refresher in Fortran.

Fortran (a contraction of Formula Translation) was the first programming language to have a standard (in 1954), but has changed significantly over the years. More recent standards (the latest being Fortran 2023) come under the umbrella term “Modern Fortran”. Fortran retains very great significance in many areas of scientific and numerical computing, particularly for applications such as quantum chemistry, plasmas, and in numerical weather prediction and climate models.

This course provides an introduction to the basics of writing Fortran. It will cover basic syntax, variables, expressions and assignments, flow of control, and introductions to i/o and user-defined types. Common Fortran idioms are introduced and contrasted with those available in C-like languages; the course will try to focus on real usage rather than formal descriptions.

At the end of the course you should be able to understand many Fortran programs and be confident to start to write well-structured and portable Fortran. Fortran is a rather “large” language, so it is not possible to cover all its features in a two or three day course. Further elements of Fortran are discussed in the “Intermediate Modern Fortran” course.

## Using bash. Some handy features

Free webinar, Wednesday 4th March 2026 15:00 - 16:00 

This webinar will take a look at the tool everyone needs on ARCHER2: bash. The idea will be to provide an overview of some useful features which may provide tips for improvement of common workflows.

The seminar should be suitable for users less familiar with bash. It will cover topics including:

-    Variables, commands, environment
-    Arithmetic
-    Search and replacement
-    Flow of control (loops and conditionals)
-    Arrays
-    Some miscellaneous examples
-    As a mild diversion, I will demonstrate that it is possible to write a parallel script in bash using MPI.

## GPU programming using OpenMP

Online 	9, 11,13,16 and 18 March 2026 10:00 - 12:00 

The OpenMP offload and OpenACC APIs support portable GPU programing using directives in Fortran, C and C++. This course will provide an introduction to GPU programming with directives, aimed at scientific application programmers wishing to develop their own software. The course will give a background on GPU architecture and programming API, and then focus on using OpenMP offload directives. The course will cover offloading code and data movement, as well as more advanced topics such as interoperability with HIP and performance tuning. We will also cover the similarities and differences between OpenMP and OpenACC.

Note that although the course will use AMD GPUs for practical exercises, it is also appropriate for those wishing to use NVIDIA or Intel GPUs.

## Reproducible computational environments using containers: introduction to Docker and Singularity

Online 	23 - 24 March 2026 10:00 - 16:00 

This course aims to introduce the use of containers with the goal of using them to effect reproducible computational environments. Such environments are useful for ensuring reproducible research outputs and for simplifying the setup of complex software dependencies across different systems. The course will introduce the use of Docker and Singularity containers but the material will be of use for whatever container technology you plan to, or end up, using. On completion of this course attendees should:

-    Have an understanding of what Docker/Singularity containers are, why they are useful and the common terminology used
-    Have a working Docker installation on your local system to allow you to use containers
-    Understand how to use existing Docker containers for common tasks
-    Be able to build your own Docker/Singularity containers by understanding both the role of a Dockerfile/Singularity recipe in building containers, and the syntax used in Dockerfiles/Singularity recipes
-    Understand how to manage Docker/Singularity containers on your local system
-    Appreciate decisions that need to be made around containerising research workflows
-    Understand the differences between Docker and Singularity containers and why Singularity is more suitable for multi-user systems (e.g. HPC)
-    Appreciate issues around reproducibility in software, understand how containers can address some of these issues and what the limits to reproducibility using containers are

## Modern C++ for Computational Scientists

Online 	15 - 17 April 2026 09:30 - 16:30 

With the recent revisions to the C++ language and standard library, the ways it is now being used are quite different. Used well, these features enable the programmer to write elegant, reusable and portable code that runs efficiently on a variety of architectures.

However it is still a very large and complex tool. This course will cover a minimal set of features to allow an experienced non-C++ programmer to get to grips with language.

These include:

-    overloading
-    templates
-    containers
-    iterators
-    lambdas
-    standard algorithms

We will also briefly cover some important libraries for numerical computing.

## Intermediate Research Software Development 

University of Manchester 	20 April 2026 13.30-17.00, 21 - 23 April 2026 09:30 - 17:00 

This course aims to teach a core set of established, intermediate-level software development skills and best practices for working as part of a team in a research environment using Python as an example programming language (see detailed Learning objectives below). The core set of skills we teach is not a comprehensive set of all-encompassing skills, but a selective set of tried-and-tested collaborative development skills that forms a firm foundation for continuing on your learning journey.

A typical learner for this course may be someone who is working in a research environment, needing to write some code, has gained basic software development skills either by self-learning or attending, e.g., a novice Software Carpentry Python course. They have been applying those skills in their domain of work by writing code for some time, e.g. half a year or more. However, their software development-related projects are now becoming larger and are involving more researchers and other stakeholders (e.g. users), for example:

Software is becoming more complex and more collaborative development effort is needed to keep the software running Software is going further than just the small group developing and/or using the code there are more users and an increasing need to add new features ‘Technical debt’ is increasing with demands to add new functionality while ensuring previous development efforts remain functional and maintainable

They now need intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code that goes beyond a few thrown-together proof-of-concept scripts, taking into consideration the lifecycle of software, writing software for stakeholders, team ethic and applying a process to understanding, designing, building, releasing, and maintaining software.

## Message Passing programming with MPI 

Imperial College London 	Wednesday 22nd - Thursday 23rd Apil 10:00 - 17:00 (In Person); Friday 1st May 10:00 - 12:30 (online)

The world’s largest supercomputers are used almost exclusively to run applications which are parallelised using Message Passing. The course covers all the basic knowledge required to write parallel programs using this programming model, and is directly applicable to almost every parallel computer architecture.

Parallel programming by definition involves co-operation between processors to solve a common task. The programmer has to define the tasks that will be executed by the processors, and also how these tasks are to synchronise and exchange data with one another. In the message-passing model the tasks are separate processes that communicate and synchronise by explicitly sending each other messages. All these parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing interface that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network linking the actual processors together. This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI). It covers point-to-point communication, non-blocking operations, derived datatypes, virtual topologies, collective communication and general design issues.
