## State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth II - Service desk closed

ARCHER2 service desk will be closed on Monday 19th September as we will be observing the bank holiday for the State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.


## The MITgcm user's guide to ARCHER2

Online webinar, Wednesday 14th September 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST

Emma Boland, British Antarctic Survey

Whether you are a seasoned pro with MITgcm or just getting started, join us for a webinar to find out how to get the most out of running it on ARCHER2. We’ll briefly cover how to install and run basic MITgcm. We can’t tell you the meaning of life, the universe, and everything but we can share what we’ve learnt on how to make your runs quick or cheap. Additionally, we’ll cover some advanced usage, including the use of TAF for adjoint runs, techniques for chaining together long runs, and containerisation.

## ARCHER2 for Package Users 	

Online 	13 October 2022 10:00 - 16:00 BST 

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
- What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
- How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
- What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?

## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) and Early Career eCSE Panel Observers calls 

### ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call: funding for software development projects of up to 18 person months available

We are very pleased to announce that the 8th ARCHER2 eCSE call
(ARCHER2-eCSE08) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation is 16:00 on 4th October 2022 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 25th October 2022.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding for RSEs (Research Software Engineers, PDRAs or equivalent) to carry out software development of codes to be run on the ARCHER2 system.

We are very pleased to announce that for this call eCSE projects can be requested for up to 18 person months of effort per project. We hope that this increase in effort will provide researchers with the opportunity to carry out more in depth improvements to software and to allow for an increase in the scope of a project's objectives. There is flexibility in the way the effort is requested. For example, a project may have more than one person working on it or the effort could be spread over a greater number of calendar months, i.e. a staff member could work on the project at less than 100% alongside other commitments or it could be worked on by a staff member who doesn't work full time. Please just get in contact with the ARCHER2 Service Desk if you wish to discuss possible scenarios.

The code(s) may already be running on ARCHER2, where the aim is to improve performance or scalability, to add functionality or to improve the usability and maintainability, or the code(s) may be running elsewhere (e.g. on a Tier-2 system) and the proposal could be to bring the software up to a level where it would perform well on ARCHER2.

For this call, software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC is eligible. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of the above.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the eCSE calls page from here

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/>

together with details of the application and review process, assessment criteria eligibility, etc.

### ARCHER2 Early Career eCSE Panel Observers call

The eCSE Panel Meeting is the meeting where eCSE proposals are reviewed and decisions are made on which proposals to fund. As part of our commitment to encouraging and developing Early Career Researchers, we are offering a small number of places to such researchers to attend the eCSE panel meeting as Early Career Observers. The aim is to give Early Career Researchers a better insight into this competitive selection process, to assist them in the preparation of future funding proposals.

The deadline for applying to attend the panel meeting as an observer is
16:00 on 4 Oct 2022 and details of the call are given here:

<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/observers/>

### eCSE call dates

Deadline for submitting eCSE08 documents for technical evaluation: 16:00 on Tuesday 4th October 2022

Deadline for Early Career Observers call: 16:00 on Tuesday 4th October 2022

Deadline for final eCSE08 submission: 16:00 Tuesday 25th October 2022

A recent webinar can be found here:
