## At-Risk Partial Maintenance: From Monday 12th September 

Over the next few weeks HPE will be performing essential work on the ARCHER2 system. This work is being undertaken to improve the stability of the system.
 
HPE have planned this work such that it will not remove ARCHER2 from service completely, but there will be periods when there are a reduced number of compute nodes available for running jobs. Users will always be able to connect to ARCHER2, access filesystems and submit jobs. As the number of compute nodes will be reduced users may experience longer queue times. 
 
The work is scheduled to start on Monday 12th September and at any time a maximum of four cabinets will be removed from service with a possible further four cabinets being drained of work in preparation for being removed from service. On 29th June HPE successfully tested the removal of four cabinets from the ARCHER2 service without it impacting on the remaining cabinets in service. (The ARCHER2 full system is 23 cabinets in total). 
 
Further details will be provided via user mailings and the [ARCHER2 Status page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html) but please do [get in touch](mailto: support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any concerns regarding this work. 






## Debugging and Optimizing Parallel Codes with Arm Forge - Debugging and DDT

Online webinar Wednesday 31st August 2022 15:00 - 16:00 BST

In this presentation we will provide an overview of Arm Forge, a cross platform, integrated environment for debugging and optimizing parallel codes at any scale. We will provide hands-on demonstrations of how Arm Forge reduces development time, simplifies debugging, and eases application performance enhancement.
Ensuring Program Correctness with Arm DDT

Using sample codes, we will walk through the major capabilities of the debugger to illustrate how DDT can debug applications ranging from a single thread to large scale

- Using Forge as a remote client
- Using semantic analysis tools to catch bugs before you even run the code
- How to use sparklines to visualize variable values across processes and threads
- Illustrate memory debugging to trap array out of bounds errors and memory leaks
- Using the array viewer to visualize multi-dimensional variables
- Using watchpoints to halt execution dependent upon expression values
- Offline debugging for large scale debugging, catching non-deterministic errors and continuous integration
- Trace points, a flexible and deterministic printf alternative
- Modifying the definition of your program without re-building using the Evaluate Window
- Debugging on a GPU (optional)
- Debugging Python (optional)

## ARCHER2 for Package Users 	

Online 	13 October 2022 10:00 - 16:00 BST 

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

- have already used other HPC systems; and
- want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

- What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
- What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
- How does this impact me as a user?
- How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
- What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
- How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
- How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
- How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
- What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?
