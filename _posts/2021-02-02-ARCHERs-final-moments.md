As the ARCHER service was switched off, our colleagues at the ACF photographed and recorded ARCHER's final moments. 

With a particular thank you to Connor, Aaron, Jordan, Craig and Paul at the ACF and to Sypro for putting this video together, we give you ARCHER's final moment. It is best with the sound on.

As we say our final farewell, my colleagues have put together a few blog articles around the service which will be released this week. Clair discusses the success of the driving test, an innovative way to encourage new users on to the system. Jo discusses life on the front line of the query system and Andy takes us through application code usage throughout the lifetime of the service.
