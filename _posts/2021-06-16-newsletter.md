## ARCHER2 Code of Conduct

We have recently published a new ARCHER2 Code of Conduct that covers all aspects of the service. The Code of Conduct can be summarised in the following way:

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in ARCHER2 events and training, using the ARCHER2 system and interacting via email or online platforms (e.g. Github) all people accept to abide by the ARCHER2 Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form or behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all activities, events and interactions:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show courtesy and respect towards others

You can read the [full Code of Conduct on the ARCHER2 website]( https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).



## Software Carpentry course

21 - 24 June 2021 09:30 - 13:00 BST

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design (Python), version control (Git), data management (SQL), and task automation (Make). Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
