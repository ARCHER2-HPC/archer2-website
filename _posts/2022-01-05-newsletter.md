## ARCHER2 Full System Transition

Charging is enabled on ARCHER2 full system from 4th January 2022.  This means that all jobs which end after 10:00 GMT on Tuesday 4th January will be charged.

As the future of the ARCHER2 4-Cabinet system is unclear beyond 4th January 2022, please remove all required data from /work on ARCHER2 4Cabinet to ARCHER2 full system,  or other safe place, before that date. Full instructions on how to do this can be found at:
<https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/archer2-migration/data-migration/>


## ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) call

We are very pleased to announce that the 6th ARCHER2 eCSE call (ARCHER2 eCSE06) is now open for proposals. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluation is 16:00 on 22nd Feb 2022 with the final deadline for proposal submission being 16:00 on 15th Mar 2022.

Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on the ARCHER2 system. For this call, software which results in research which is within the remit of EPSRC is eligible. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of the above. Proposals may request effort from between 1 and 12 person months (inclusive).
