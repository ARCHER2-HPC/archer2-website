### What are we looking for?

The ARCHER2 Image Competition is an event for all users of ARCHER/ARCHER2 to share their images or videos of "ARCHER and ARCHER2 Enabling Research"

We are looking for entries that will demonstrate the contribution of ARCHER/ARCHER2 to research.

Entries might include (but are not limited to):

-    images generated from calculations that used ARCHER/ARCHER2
-    photographs of equipment and/or researchers working on projects which use ARCHER/ARCHER2 for computation
-    images generated from data processed using ARCHER/ARCHER2
-    images demonstrating the contribution of ARCHER/ARCHER2 to research
-    videos or animations generated from data processed using ARCHER/ARCHER2
-    images or videos showing the impact of research carried out on ARCHER/ARCHER2
-    infographic (still, video, cartoon, diagram) showing how ARCHER/ARCHER2 has contributed to your research or knowledge, or how it is part of your research process

Images don't need to have been generated in the last few months - any images from any time in the ARCHER or ARCHER2 services, including photos relating to your work, and images or videos that have been post-processed.
