## RSECon23 Training satellite event

We are delighted to announce that following RSECon23 we will be holding a satellite event looking at the training RSE’s provide to the research community, on Friday 8th September at Swansea University Bay Campus. 

The event will have four themes:
- 	Delivery of Materials
- 	Development of Materials
- 	Policy, Culture, and Resourcing
- 	Developing RSE’s to deliver training
[Full information can be found on the website](https://rsecon23.society-rse.org/satellite-events/)

[Registration is now open for RSECon and satellite events](https://rsecon23.society-rse.org/) and closes on 31st July.   You can sign up for as many or as few events as you like, using the same form.

We hope to see you there!


## Parallel Performance Analysis using Scalasca

22 - 23 August 2023 09:30 - 16:30 BST in [Oxford](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/locations/oxford-dtc)

[Scalasca](https://www.scalasca.org/) is a software tool that supports the performance optimization of parallel programs by measuring and analyzing their runtime behaviour. It uses execution profiles and traces generated by the community-developed Score-P instrumentation and measurement infrastructure. The analysis identifies potential performance bottlenecks – in particular those concerning communication and synchronization – and offers guidance in exploring their causes.

[Scalasca](https://www.scalasca.org/) targets mainly scientific and engineering applications based on the programming interfaces MPI and OpenMP, including hybrid applications based on a combination of the two. The tool has been specifically designed for use on large-scale systems, but is also well suited for small- and medium-scale HPC platforms. The software is available for free download under the New BSD open-source license.

This course will cover how to use the tools in practice, delivered by members of their development team. Practical exercises will be conducted on the UK National HPC Service ARCHER2, an HPC Cray EX system; attendees will be given accounts on ARCHER2 for the duration of the course. Although example parallel programs will be provided, attendees are encouraged to analyse the performance of their own applications on ARCHER2.

## Change to default version of ONETEP on ARCHER2

The default version of ONETEP on ARCHER2 will be changed to a newer version `onetep/6.1.43.0-CCE-LibSci` on Mon 17 July 2023. The current default version is `onetep/6.1.9.0-CCE-LibSci` 

If you wish to continue to use the older version after this change, you will need to change your job submission scripts to explicitly load the older version.


## Assessing the Credibility of Computational Models: Application of the FDA-Endorsed ASME VV-40

Free webinar 1pm BST  Wednesday 26 July 2023
CompBioMed present a webinar on how to get the FDA to endorse your biomedical models.

Not an ARCHER2 event but may be of interest to some ARCHER2 users.
