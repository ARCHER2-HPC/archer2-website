## Data Carpentry course

14 - 17 June 2021 09:30 - 13:00 BST
 
Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learnersâ€™ existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

The workshop will cover:

- Data Organization in Spreadsheets. OpenRefine for Data Cleaning.
- Introduction to R. Data analysis and Visualization.
- Data Management with SQL.
