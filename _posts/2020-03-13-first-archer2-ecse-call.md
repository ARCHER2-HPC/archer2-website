The ARCHER2 Embedded (eCSE) Programme: Funding RSE staff Embedded within Research Communities

We are pleased to announce that the ARCHER2 service has funding for a significant Embedded CSE (eCSE) programme across the lifetime of the service. The eCSE programme will fund dedicated RSE staff embedded within their research communities to develop the UKâ€™s software base and thus enhance the benefit of ARCHER2 to UK science.

Funding will be allocated using an open, fair and peer reviewed funding programme. The service will support diversity and inclusion and promote engagement from specific target areas, such as early career researchers. To ensure that the eCSE programme is accessible to everyone, we will lower barriers to participation by providing a strong support system, active throughout the lifecycle of an eCSE project: from application to conclusion.

There will be a regular series of calls for proposals, with three calls per year.

The first ARCHER2 eCSE call will open on 14th April 2020. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluations is 12th May 2020, with the final deadline for proposal submission being 2nd June 2020. Further details will be published on the [eCSE Programme]({{ site.baseurl }}/ecse/) page when the call opens.

The list of all eCSE projects funded under the first ARCHER service can be found on the [ARCHER funded eCSE projects page](https://www.archer.ac.uk/community/eCSE/).
