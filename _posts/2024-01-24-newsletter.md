## ARCHER2 GPUs webinar

online, 31st January 2024 14:00 - 16:00 GMT

Please note: The date for this webinar is provisional and will be confirmed once the GPU installation and integration works are all successfully completed.

This user webinar will discuss the new GPU nodes and will have EPCC and HPE staff available to answer questions

This online session is open to all.

## GPU eCSE software development call and associated Early Career Observer call 

### GPU eCSE call

The first call of a new programme of eCSE calls focussing on GPU-based software development is now open. We invite proposals to develop software that facilitates research targeted at UKRI’s digital research infrastructure e.g. future Exascale supercomputing services, UK national AI services, national Tier-2 HPC services. The call is open to research across all of UKRI’s remit.

The first GPU eCSE call (GPU-eCSE01) opened on the 17 Jan 2024. The final deadline for proposal submission is 16:00 on 19 Mar 2024 via the ARCHER2 SAFE. Please note that for this call there is no separate technical evaluation stage or separate technical evaluation form.

Funding will enable the employment of an RSE (a Research Software Engineer, PDRA or equivalent) to work specifically on the relevant software to enable new features or improve the performance of the software to be run on GPU-based architectures. Funding can be requested for up to 36 person months of effort per project for a duration of up to 2 calendar years. There is flexibility in the way the effort is requested. For example, a project may have more than one person working on it or the effort could be spread over a greater number of calendar months, i.e. a staff member could work on the project at less than 100% alongside other commitments or it could be worked on by a staff member who doesn’t work full time. Please just get in contact with the [ARCHER2 Service Desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you wish to discuss possible scenarios. Projects are expected to start between 2-6 months after a call closes. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the ARCHER2 centralised CSE support team at EPCC or a mixture of the above.

Projects may utilise the GPU component of ARCHER2 or other suitable GPU resources to complete the technical work. If the proposal plans to use the GPU component of ARCHER2, successful projects will be given access to these resources. If projects plan to utilise other systems, you should ensure you have suitable resources available to complete the project successfully. Please contact and arrange this access with the relevant service provider before submission.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the [eCSE calls page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/)

### Early Career Observer call

The eCSE Panel Meeting is the meeting where eCSE proposals are reviewed and decisions are made on which proposals to fund. As part of our commitment to encouraging and developing Early Career Researchers, we are offering a small number of places to such researchers to attend the eCSE panel meeting as Early Career Observers. The aim is to give Early Career Researchers a better insight into this competitive selection process, to assist them in the preparation of future funding proposals.

The deadline for applying to attend the panel meeting as an observer is 16:00 on 27 Feb 2024 via the ARCHER2 service desk. [Details of the call ](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/observers/)

## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science
 
We are pleased to announce the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science will take place on the 7th – 8th March 2024 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh.

The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from members of the ARCHER2 research consortia and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session focusing on preparing the UK science community for future Exascale systems. All attendees are welcome to join the drink reception on the evening of the first day.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee. The registration deadline is 29th February 2024.

## ARCHER2 User Survey 2023

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 Annual User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.<br/>
Additionally, if you enter your ARCHER2 username in the final question, then you will be **entered into the prize draw to win one of five £50 Amazon vouchers**.

[Complete the survey](https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2023)

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.

**The survey will close on Wednesday 31st January 2024** so please ensure you have completed it before then.




## Data Analysis and Visualisation in Python

Online, 7 - 8 February 2024 09:30 - 17:00 GMT

Python is a general purpose programming language that is useful for writing scripts to work effectively and reproducibly with data.

This is an introduction to Python designed for participants with no programming experience. This course covers:

-    Some basic information about Python syntax.
-    The Jupyter notebook interface.
-    How to import CSV files.
-    Using the Pandas package to work with data frames.
-    How to calculate summary information from a data frame.
-    Brief introduction to plotting.
-    How to work with databases directly from Python.

## Data Carpentry

Online, 12 - 15 February 2024 09:30 - 13:00 GMT

Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners’ existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset from the Portal Project Teaching Database and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualization. There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher would use.
 	
- Data Organization in Spreadsheets: 	Learn how to organize tabular data, handle date formatting, carry out quality control and quality assurance and export data to use with downstream applications.
- Data Cleaning with OpenRefine: 	Explore, summarize, and clean tabular data reproducibly.
- Data Analysis and Visualization in R: 	Import data into R, calculate summary statistics, and create publication-quality graphics.
- Data Management with SQL: 	Structure data for database import. Query data within a relational database.
