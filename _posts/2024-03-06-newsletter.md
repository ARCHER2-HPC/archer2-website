## GPU eCSE software development call 

### GPU eCSE call

The first call of a new programme of eCSE calls focussing on GPU-based software development is now open. We invite proposals to develop software that facilitates research targeted at UKRI’s digital research infrastructure e.g. future Exascale supercomputing services, UK national AI services, national Tier-2 HPC services. The call is open to research across all of UKRI’s remit.

The first GPU eCSE call (GPU-eCSE01) opened on the 17 Jan 2024. The final deadline for proposal submission is 16:00 on 19 Mar 2024 via the ARCHER2 SAFE. Please note that for this call there is no separate technical evaluation stage or separate technical evaluation form.

Funding will enable the employment of an RSE (a Research Software Engineer, PDRA or equivalent) to work specifically on the relevant software to enable new features or improve the performance of the software to be run on GPU-based architectures. Funding can be requested for up to 36 person months of effort per project for a duration of up to 2 calendar years. There is flexibility in the way the effort is requested. For example, a project may have more than one person working on it or the effort could be spread over a greater number of calendar months, i.e. a staff member could work on the project at less than 100% alongside other commitments or it could be worked on by a staff member who doesn’t work full time. Please just get in contact with the [ARCHER2 Service Desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you wish to discuss possible scenarios. Projects are expected to start between 2-6 months after a call closes. Funding can be requested for staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can include staff from the ARCHER2 centralised CSE support team at EPCC or a mixture of the above.

Projects may utilise the GPU component of ARCHER2 or other suitable GPU resources to complete the technical work. If the proposal plans to use the GPU component of ARCHER2, successful projects will be given access to these resources. If projects plan to utilise other systems, you should ensure you have suitable resources available to complete the project successfully. Please contact and arrange this access with the relevant service provider before submission.

More details of how to apply are available by following the link to the [eCSE calls page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/)

### eCSE call dates


Deadline for final GPU eCSE submission: 16:00 on 19 Mar 2024 (via the [ARCHER2 SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/))



## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science
 
We are pleased to announce the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science will take place on the 7th – 8th March 2024 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh.

The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from members of the ARCHER2 research consortia and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session focusing on preparing the UK science community for future Exascale systems. All attendees are welcome to join the drink reception on the evening of the first day.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee. The registration deadline is 29th February 2024.

## Overview of the ARCHER2 GPU Development Platform

Online, 12 - 13 March 2024 09:00 - 17:00 and 09:00 - 15:30

This workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to understand how to port, execute and optimize applications for the ARCHER2 GPU Test and Development platform.

The workshop is a mixture of lectures and practical hands-on sessions. Example exercises will be provided but attendees are encouraged to bring their own application and a session is reserved where attendees can concentrate on their own applications.

Specific topics that will be covered include:

-    System Architecture.
-    Compiling and running applications on AMD GPUs (Programming Environment, compilers, scientific libraries, Slurm).
-    OpenACC and OpenMP offloading with the Cray PE.
-    GPU programming with HIP.
-    Application profiling and debugging on GPUs.

## Introduction to Modern Fortran

Durham, 3 - 4 April 2024 09:30 - 16:30 BST

Fortran (a contraction of Formula Translation) was the first programming langauge to have a standard (in 1954), but has changed significantly over the years. More recent standards (the latest being Fortran 2018) come under the umbrella term “Modern Fortran”. Fortran retains very great significance in many areas of scientific and numerical computing, particularly for applications such as quantum chemistry, plasmas, and in numerical weather prediction and climate models.

This course provides an introduction to the basics of writing Fortran. It will cover basic syntax, variables, expressions and assignments, flow of control, and introductions to i/o and user-defined types. Common Fortran idioms are introduced and contrasted with those available in C-like languages; the course will try to focus on real usage rather than formal descriptions.

## Intermediate Modern Fortran

Edinburgh, 10 - 11 April 2024 09:30 - 16:30

Fortran (a contraction of Formula Translation) was the first programming language to have a standard (in 1954), but has changed significantly over the years. More recent standards (the latest being Fortran 2018) come under the umbrella term “Modern Fortran”. Fortran retains very great significance in many areas of scientific and numerical computing, particularly for applications such as quantum chemistry, plasmas, engineering and fluid dynamics, and in numerical weather prediction and climate models.

This intermediate course concentrates on some of the more recent features which are central to Modern Fortran. Attendees should be familiar with the basics of Fortran programming

## Introduction to Xcompact3D

London, 15 April 2024 10:00 - 17:00

This course focused on Xcompact3d which is a Fortran-based framework of high-order finite-difference flow solvers dedicated to the study of turbulent flows. Dedicated to Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES) for which the largest turbulent scales are simulated, it can combine the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes. Its user-friendliness, simplicity, versatility, accuracy, scalability, portability and efficiency makes it an attractive tool for the Computational Fluid Dynamics community. It is one of the four flagship solvers of the UK Turbulence Consortium. The course will run for 1 day comprising a mixture of lectures and tutorials.

## Recently added known issues
 
The "[Known Issues](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/known-issues/)" page of the ARCHER2 Documentation
<https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/known-issues/>
lists all current open known issues including a description of the issue, its symptoms and any work-arounds.

- When close to storage quota, jobs may slow down or produce corrupted files (Added: 2024-02-27)
For situations where users are close to user or project quotas on work (Lustre) file systems we have seen cases of the following behaviour:
    - Jobs run very slowly as IO slows down
    - IO calls seem to complete successfully but not all data is written (so output is corrupted)
    - No "disk quota exceeded" error is seen

If you see these symptoms: slower than expected performance, data corruption; then you should check if you are close to your storage quota (either user or project quota). If you are, you may be experiencing this issue. Either remove data to free up space or request more storage quota.
