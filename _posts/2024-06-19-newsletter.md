## Advanced MPI, Online, 27-28 June 2024

Have you ever wondered what happens inside the MPI library when you send a message? Or, whether you can exploit the fact that two processes are running on the same node to optimise communications or save memory? These issues and more will be addressed in the upcoming ARCHER2 course "Advanced MPI" running online on 27-28 June. The course also provides the opportunity to discuss your questions on MPI topics and get advice for implementing and improving the use of MPI in your software from MPI experts.

For more details and to register, see:
