As part of our Continiual Service Improvement, we are moving to a new system for registering for our ARCHER2 Training Courses.

Previously, all course registrations have been done via a web form, and once registration is approved, then an invitation is sent out with details of how to register in SAFE and request a machine account in a designated project.

We have now streamlined this process, so registration is done within SAFE, and the account request in the correct project is now part of the approval process, done automatically by the system.

The information about upcoming training courses remains the same, and can be found on our

- [Upcoming Courses page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/#upcoming-training)

however the [Register link](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/TransitionServlet/TrainingCourse//-/Transition=INDEX) will now take you right in to SAFE where you will complete the registration process.

If you do not already have a SAFE account, you should [create one](../safe-for-users/#how-to-register-on-safe).

The new application form will ask for your "Reason for applying", and your "Requested username" for use in the training project.

You will need to accept the Terms and Conditions of Access.

Paste in or upload your ssh public key if you do not have a default key set up in SAFE [already](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/safe-for-users/#how-to-add-an-ssh-public-key-to-your-account)

Your registration will be reviewed by a member of the team and once approved you will receive a confirmation email with the course details.

Documentation for this new process can be found in our [SAFE Docs](link)

Please do not hesitate to contact the [Service Desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any questions or experience any issues with the new process.
