## From 0 to ARCHER2 in 65k lines of Rust

Online webinar,  Wednesday 9th April 2025 15:00 - 16:00 BST

Prof Timo Betcke, Professor of Computational Mathematics and Associate Director, UCL Centre for Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

Rust is an exciting programming language. Within 10 years of its 1.0 release it has found its ways into Android, the Windows Kernel, cloud computing, and many other domains.
But is it ready for the HPC Challenge? Three years ago we started off with 0 lines of code and the desire to develop a scalable Galerkin Boundary Element Code for ARCHER2. The caveat,
we wanted to make it work in Rust. In this talk we give a breakdown of this journey, discuss things that worked really well in Rust, and other things that did not work so well.
While the talk itself is not a Rust tutorial we want to give a realistic expectation of what expects those who want to do Rust at scale.

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.

## The International Collaboration Towards Net Zero Computational Modelling and Simulation (CONTINENTS) webinar

Tuesday the 22nd of April at 16:00 
 
The International Collaboration Towards Net Zero Computational Modelling and Simulation (CONTINENTS), is hosting the second instance of its webinar on Tuesday the 22nd of April at 16h UK time, which will be delivered by Oliver Watt-Meyer (AllenAI), with the title: "The Ai2 Climate Emulator: Capabilities, Challenges and Opportunities", the abstract is available below. No registration needed, please feel free to re-share.

### Abstract: 

Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE) is a fast machine learning model that simulates global atmospheric variability in a changing climate over time scales ranging from hours to centuries. It generates atmospheric phenomena such as the Madden Julian Oscillation, sudden stratospheric warmings, and tropical cyclones while also accurately simulating 20th century climate trends and El Niño-related interannual variability. Its efficiency—running 1500 simulated years per day on an NVIDIA H100—will make climate models more accessible and enable the generation of very large ensembles.

## GPU programming using directives

Online, 22, 24, 28 and 30 April 2025 10:00 - 12:00 BST
 
The OpenMP offload and OpenACC APIs support portable GPU programing using directives in Fortran, C and C++. This course will provide an introduction to GPU programming with directives, aimed at scientific application programmers wishing to develop their own software. The course will give a background on GPU architecture and programming API, and then focus on using OpenMP offload directives. The course will cover offloading code and data movement, as well as more advanced topics such as interoperability with HIP and performance tuning. We will also cover the similarities and differences between OpenMP and OpenACC.

Note that although the course will use AMD GPUs for practical exercises, it is also appropriate for those wishing to use NVIDIA or Intel GPUs.

## Modern C++ for Computational Scientists

Durham, 23 - 24 April 2025 09:30 - 16:00

With the recent revisions to the C++ language and standard library, the ways it is now being used are quite different. Used well, these features enable the programmer to write elegant, reusable and portable code that runs efficiently on a variety of architectures.

However it is still a very large and complex tool. This course will cover a minimal set of features to allow an experienced non-C++ programmer to get to grips with language.

These include:

-     overloading
-     templates
-     containers
-     iterators
-     lambdas
-     standard algorithms

We will also briefly cover some important libraries for numerical computing.

## Green software use on HPC

Edinburgh, 13 May 2025 10:00 - 15:30 BST

This lesson introduces environmental sustainability principles in the context of high performance computing (HPC) systems. Understanding the scale of emissions from different sources is critical to being able to make changes to work in a more environmentally sustainable way. This lesson will give you the ability to understand emissions arising from use of HPC system and how to quantify them. We will use practical examples and real data from an existing HPC facility to illustrate the concepts. By the end of this lesson you should:

-     Be able to understand the concept of carbon efficiency and how it relates to energy efficiency including cases where energy efficiency can be at odds with carbon efficiency
-     Know about how HPC systems potentially reduce emissions
-     Understand carbon intensity of electricity generation and the implications for carbon aware use of HPC
-     Appreciate the embodied emissions associated with HPC hardware and how they impact carbon aware use of HPC
-     Be aware of the frameworks used to measure and report on carbon emissions and how the terms used in these frameworks map onto HPC
-     Gain practical advice on how you can measure and improve the carbon efficiency of your use of HPC

We use the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2 as an example throughout this lesson but the principles and learning should be applicable to any HPC system.
