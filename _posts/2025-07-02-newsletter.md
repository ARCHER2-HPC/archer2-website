## ARCHER2 User Survey 2025

We are committed to continually improving the ARCHER2 Service and would like to request your input to help us understand what is important to you, where the Service is working well and where there is scope for improvement.

The ARCHER2 User Survey consists of just a few questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.
Additionally, if you enter your ARCHER2 username in the final question, then you will be entered into the prize draw to win one of five £50 Amazon vouchers.

[Complete the survey]( https://bit.ly/ARCHER2-User-Survey-2025)

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for you and to help identify key areas for service development.


## Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) Power Outage: Friday 29th August - Monday 15th September

Due to a significant Health and Safety risk, associated with our power supply to the site, that requires action at the ACF, there will be a full power outage to the site from Friday 29th August - Monday 15th September.  Specialised external contractors will be working on a 24/7 basis for the outage period replacing switchgear.

### ARCHER2 User Impact

ARCHER2 will be completely powered off for the duration of this period.

Users will not be able to connect to ARCHER2 and will not be able to access data on any of the ARCHER2 file systems. The system will be drained of jobs ahead of the power outage and jobs will not run during this period. Any queued jobs will remain in the queue during the outage and jobs will start once the service is returned.

SAFE and the ARCHER2 website will be available during the outage period so users can continue to contact us and we will be providing updates during the outage on the[ Status page]( https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html).

We will notify users once the service is available and we expect this to be on Monday 15th September.

We apologise for the inconvenience of this essential outage. Please contact [support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any questions.


## Advanced MPI

Online, 29 - 30 July 2025 10:00 - 16:00

This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of MPI and also explore some of its more recent and advanced features.

The most recent MPI standard, MPI 5.0 approved on 5th June 2025, runs to over 1000 pages and includes a huge number of functions. Even the most basic of MPI operations, such as a matching pair of MPI_Send / MPI Recv calls, can be implemented in surprisingly complicated ways; a simple question such as “what happens if I post a send and there is no receive” may not have a simple answer! An understanding of how the MPI library is implemented in practice can therefore be useful for users wanting to achieve optimal performance.

To help ensure that we cover the topics that are of most interest to attendees, you will receive a short questionnaire after registration asking to rank your interest in the following topics:

- Interactive (and fun!) quiz on basics of MPI
- History and development of MPI
- How MPI implementation details affect performance
- Advanced collectives: use of derived datatypes and neighbourhood collectives
- MPI Shared Memory Model (MPI equivalent of OpenMP shared arrays)
- General tips and tricks for MPI programming
- Hybrid MPI+OpenMP
- Remote Memory Access (MPI_Put, MPI_Get etc)
- Parallel IO with MPI-IO
- Techniques for overlapping communication and calculation

and we will try and cover the most popular topics.

The Women in HPC Workshop is the leading SC event focused on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). This year we celebrate our 23rd international workshop, aiming to raise awareness and address issues around diversity and inclusion within the HPC community and workforce. 

### Early Career Opportunities: 
An important part of our workshop is offering a platform for early-career researchers to present at an international conference, build valuable networks, and experience their first SC. We invite anyone from an underrepresented group who considers themselves to be ‘early career’ to submit an extended abstract (up to 2 pages) in any area involving High Performance Computing. Successful authors will be asked to present in a short lightning talk (3 minutes) highlighting their work at the WHPC workshop. 

### Benefits for successful authors: 

- Showcase your research at an international conference! 
- Receive mentorship from experienced colleagues.  
- Apply for a travel fellowship of up to $3,800 (approximately £3,000)!
- Have your extended abstract published in our proceedings.

**DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS: AUGUST 8th, 2025, Midnight – AoE**
