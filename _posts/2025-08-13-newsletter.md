## Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) Power Outage: Friday 29th August - Monday 15th September

Due to a significant Health and Safety risk, associated with our power supply to the site, that requires action at the ACF, there will be a full power outage to the site from Friday 29th August - Monday 15th September.  Specialised external contractors will be working on a 24/7 basis for the outage period replacing switchgear.

### ARCHER2 User Impact

ARCHER2 will be completely powered off for the duration of this period.

Users will not be able to connect to ARCHER2 and will not be able to access data on any of the ARCHER2 file systems. The system will be drained of jobs ahead of the power outage and jobs will not run during this period. Any queued jobs will remain in the queue during the outage and jobs will start once the service is returned.

SAFE and the ARCHER2 website will be available during the outage period so users can continue to contact us and we will be providing updates during the outage on the[ Status page]( https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html).

We will notify users once the service is available and we expect this to be on Monday 15th September.

We apologise for the inconvenience of this essential outage. Please contact [support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any questions.

## Message Passing programming with MPI

Leeds, 18 - 19 August 09:30 - 17:00 (face to face), Wednesday 27th August 14:00 - 16:30 (online)

The world’s largest supercomputers are used almost exclusively to run applications which are parallelised using Message Passing. The course covers all the basic knowledge required to write parallel programs using this programming model, and is directly applicable to almost every parallel computer architecture.

Parallel programming by definition involves co-operation between processors to solve a common task. The programmer has to define the tasks that will be executed by the processors, and also how these tasks are to synchronise and exchange data with one another. In the message-passing model the tasks are separate processes that communicate and synchronise by explicitly sending each other messages. All these parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing interface that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network linking the actual processors together. This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI). It covers point-to-point communication, non-blocking operations, derived datatypes, virtual topologies, collective communication and general design issues.

The course is delivered in an intensive two-day face-to-face format using EPCC’s dedicated training facilities, followed by a half-day online follow up session. It is taught using a variety of methods including formal lectures, practical exercises, programming examples and informal tutorial discussions. This enables lecture material to be supported by the tutored practical sessions in order to reinforce the key concepts.

## National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus 
### Autumn Conference : Edinburgh, Monday 22nd and Tuesday 23rd September 

The National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus aims to build collaboration and knowledge exchange for federating across the stakeholder communities that use and provide computational services. A key objective is to produce a roadmap for the future of federated compute services in the UK.

Please join us at the autumn conference in Edinburgh on Monday 22nd and Tuesday 23rd September. 
[Registration]( https://indico.ph.qmul.ac.uk/event/2299/overview )

Further details regarding the 2nd flexible funding call will be available at the meeting including a mini-sandpit. 


## NetDRIVE Second Call for Community Projects and Champions 

The NetDRIVE 2nd call for community projects has been published, offering over £1m for activities contributing towards sustainable research computing for UKRI: 
-	[Guidance and application forms]( https://eng.ox.ac.uk/netdrive/netdrive-calls/second-funding-call/ ) 
-	The total budget for community projects will be £1m (100% FEC, with projects being awarded 80% FEC). 
-	The 2nd call will have two components: around 20% of funds will be reserved for projects led by early career applicants (submissions of full proposals close October 24th , but applications to join a sandpit event should be submitted by September 10th) and the remainder will be open to all (submissions close October 10th). 
-	There is also funding in this call for 3 champions with social science qualifications, with two of these positions reserved for early career applicants.
