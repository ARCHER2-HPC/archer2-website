Many thanks to all ARCHER2 users who completed the User Survey this year.    


<!--more-->

We know that when you get asked to review every pair of socks you buy, feedback and survey fatigue sets in very quickly.
People who provided their contacts details will hear soon if they are one of the lucky winners of 5 £50 Amazon vouchers.  You can see the full report including all user comments and suggestions on our [reports page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/reports/)

The scores on the doors were:


| Service Aspect | 	2024/5 Mean Score <br> (out of 5)	| 2022-2024 Mean Score <br>(out of 5) |
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
| Overall |	4.6 |	4.4  |
| Hardware |	4.0	| 3.9 |
| Software |	3.8	| 3.8 |
| Service Desk |	4.6	| 4.6 |
| Documentation	| 4.1	| 4.1 |
| Website	| 4.1	| 4.1 |
| Training	| 4.4	| 4.3 |
| Webinars and virtual tutorials	| 4.2 |	4.2 |


As you can see user happiness with the overall service and particular aspects of it have either increased or remained constant, which is great.
We wanted to let you know that your comments and suggestions are read, reviewed and where possible acted upon.  From the comments and suggestions received there were themes:
-	Reviewing the numbers of concurrent jobs that can be run and the queuing priorities – these suggestions have been passed to our queues meeting to review
-	Changes to supported and installed software – these have been passed to our CSE team to review
-	SAFE functionality – passed to the SAFE development team for review
-	Hardware suggestions – these will be looked at for the next service to ARCHER2
-	Documentation – these are being reviewed by our Web and Docs team

Where the changes made as a result of your suggestion are significant and not obvious we will aim to include details in the appropriate weekly user mailing.

Thanks again, and if you have feedback for us, please don’t feel you have to wait for the next user survey to tell us.  You can send feedback and suggestion at any time through the service desk.
