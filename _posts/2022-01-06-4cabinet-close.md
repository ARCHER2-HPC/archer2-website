This morning, we were notified by HPE that the ARCHER2 4Cabinet system will be removed from service on Monday 10th January at 12:00 GMT. Users will be unable to access the system after this time.

Please ensure you have removed any data (including software) that you require that is stored on /work on the ARCHER2 4Cabinet system.
