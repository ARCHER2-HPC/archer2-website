Day 4 and the vast majority of the work has been done, with the power commissioned and the management and storage systems configured and tested. As of last night, remote access was also enabled. As we near completion a number of our American colleagues have now left to return to the US, we wish them a safe journey home. We will see you again for the 23 cabinet build.

The water required for the cooling system also arrived yesterday and the system was filled with this and tested fully, circulating alongside the siteâ€™s water supply.

Finally the overhead tray, doors and trims were fitted, we now have a complete looking machine. Today is all about powering on the full system and stress testing. We are almost there!
