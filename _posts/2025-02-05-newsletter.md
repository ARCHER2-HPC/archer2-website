## ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025


Following the success of ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2024, we are pleased to announce that [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2025/) will take place on the 14th - 15th May 2025 in Edinburgh at South Hall, The University of Edinburgh. 

The event will provide ARCHER2 users with the opportunity to showcase their science achievements on ARCHER2. The two-day programme will include a variety of talks from ARCHER2 researchers and other invited presenters involved in the ARCHER2 service, a poster session and a panel session.

The event is in-person and there is no registration fee.

We would like to invite the ARCHER2 community to submit posters for presentation at the ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025.
Posters should demonstrate your work on ARCHER2, showcasing the science outcomes and impact achieved.

## Advanced OpenMP

Online, 18, 20, 25 and 27 February 2025 10:00 - 12:00 GMT

OpenMP is the industry standard for shared-memory programming, which enables serial programs to be parallelised using compiler directives.This course is aimed at programmers seeking to deepen their understanding of OpenMP and explore some of its more recent and advanced features.

This course will cover topics including nested parallelism, OpenMP tasks, the OpenMP memory model, performance tuning, hybrid OpenMP + MPI, OpenMP implementations, and recently added features in OpenMP.

Please note that this course will not cover using OpenMP for GPU programming â€“ this will be the main topic of an upcoming ARCHER2 course on GPU Programming with Directives.

Hands-on practical programming exercises make up a significant, and integral, part of this course.

Attendees should be familiar with the basics of OpenMP, including parallel regions, data scoping, work sharing directives and synchronisation constructs. Access will be given to appropriate hardware for all the exercises, although many of them can also be performed on a standard Linux laptop.
