Supported by partner organizations in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Africa and the United States, the school provides an intensive week of technical instruction in MPI, OpenMP, GPU programming, performance engineering, scientific software development, Big Data analytics, complemented by electronic poster sessions, panel discussions, networking activities and a structured mentoring program.

MSc and PhD students studying at the UK institutions are [invited to apply]( https://ss26.ihpcss.org/application)
 
The application deadline is  23:59 AOE (Anywhere On Earth), January 31, 2026.




## NFCS Network Plus project, UKRI research data landscape survey

The National Federation of Compute Services (NFCS)  is exploring the benefits that establishing a federation of national, regional, and institutional computing resources within the UK could provide to researchers and service providers. Towards this end, we are seeking input from those who generate datasets through their research that they may make available through data publishing services, and also from those who run these services, as data is seen as an important component of these federations. 

We would be grateful if you could [complete the survey](
 https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/edinburgh/nfcs-survey)
 
You can fill this as a person who generates data and may make it available through a data publishing service, or as one of the people that runs such as a service, or, if you participate in both roles, as both. It should take around 15 minutes to fill in the survey per role. <br>
We are hoping for as wide a participation in this survey as possible so please share this with your colleagues. <br>
The survey closes on 31st March 2026.  Thank you for your participation.
