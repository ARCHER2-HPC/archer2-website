title: Advancing PDC Hazard Modelling&amp; Benchmarking Pyroclastic Density Current Models Against Large-Scale Experiments
text:  Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) are the most deadly of all volcanic hazards. An international consortium of volcanologists has used the computational power of ARCHER2 to run highresolution PDC simulations using data captured from a state-ofthe-art experimental facility in New Zealand.
