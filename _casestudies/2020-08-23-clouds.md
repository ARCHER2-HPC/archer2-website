title: Improving cloud modelling for better weather and climate predicution.
text:  Current weather and climate models struggle to resolve the complex details of the interactions between clouds and their environment.<br />     A team of researchers from the University of St Andrews and University of Leeds had previously developed a new numerical model, MPIC (Moist Parcel-In-Cell), which deals with the dynamics of clouds. These researchers have now incorporated this code into a community code used by atmospheric scientists around the UK, the MONC (Met Office NERC Cloud) framework.
