title: Forecasting the dispersion of volcanic ash and gas.
text: The National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS), the British Geological Survey (BGS), the UK Met Office (UKMO) and the Icelandic Met Office (IMO) work under a Memorandum of Understanding on collaborative projects aimed at improving response to volcanic events. A dispersion modelling exercise led by the UKMO was conducted in June 2019 to improve the partnersâ€™ awareness of the volcanic ash dispersion modelling capabilities at each institution and test the ability of each institution to run its dispersion models.
