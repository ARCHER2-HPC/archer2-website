title: Cellular blood flow modelling towards precision healthcare for placental disorders
text:  Disorders of the placenta are among the leading causes of pregnancy complications, resulting in insufficient oxygen and nutrients reaching the fetus. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have used the power of ARCHER2 to carry out detailed modelling of placental blood flow, with the aim of being able to identify minute anatomical changes in the placenta that may lead to potential complications.
