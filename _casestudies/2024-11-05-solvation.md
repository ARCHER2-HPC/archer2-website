title: Solvation and Charge Transfer Processes at Semiconductor/Liquid Water Interfaces
text:  The generation of hydrogen and oxygen through water splitting is considered to be a key technology for energy storage. However, no e!icient catalyst for this process has yet been found. Researchers at University College London have used the power of ARCHER2 to investigate the microscopic behaviour of water molecules at their interface with semiconductors to help in rationalising catalyst performance.
