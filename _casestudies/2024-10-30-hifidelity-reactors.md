title: High-Fidelity Simulations to Improve Performance and Safety of Nuclear Reactors
text:  Nuclear power, characterised as a sustainable and environmentally friendly low carbon energy source, stands as a pivotal component of the UK’s ambitious Net-Zero strategies for 2050. Central to the use of nuclear power is the industry’s paramount commitment to safety. Researchers from the STFC Daresbury Laboratory, the University of Sheffield and EDF R&D have leveraged the computational power of ARCHER2 to carry out high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of Pressurised Water Reactor fuel assembly under conditions of clad ballooning, mimicking a potential issue with the integrity of a fuel rod. This endeavour aims to gain a deeper understanding of the safety implications of such a scenario, including potential coolant channel blockages, as well as the resulting coolability impairment and heat transfer alteration in decay heat removal.
