title: High-Fidelity Simulations to Improve Performance and Safety of Nuclear Reactors
text:  Nuclear power is a pivotal component of the UK’s ambitious Net-Zero strategies for 2050. Central to its use is the industry’s paramount commitment to safety. Researchers from STFC Daresbury Laboratory, University of Sheffield and EDF R&D have leveraged the computational power of ARCHER2 to carry out high-fidelity simulations of Pressurised Water Reactor fuel assembly under conditions of clad ballooning, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the safety implications of a potential issue with the integrity of a fuel rod.
