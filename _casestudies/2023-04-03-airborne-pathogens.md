title: Predicting airborne pathogen spread indoors.
text:  Whenever we exhale, we release tiny droplets which may contain pathogens. Researchers at the University of Birmingham have used ARCHER2 to model how the airborne transmission of these droplets is affected by factors such as ventilation and heating.<br> Understanding this is key to making indoor spaces more resilient and preventing large-scale spread of diseases such as COVID-19, tuberculosis or measles.
