title: Simulating a flexible infectious viral protein
text:  Disordered proteins play important roles in various diseases, including cancer and certain viral infections. These proteins can change shape depending on their biological context, making them challenging to study. Through an ARCHER2 Pioneer Project, researchers from University College London, Kingâ€™s College London, and the Francis Crick Institute conducted extensive, computationally demanding simulations to characterise a specific region of a protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for causing COVID-19.
