summary: Computer simulation of fluids - which encompasses both gases and liquids - is important in many contexts. Such computations are the basis of weather and climate forecasts, and many engineering applications such as aerodynamics. At smaller scales, the same ideas can be used to study e.g., blood flow in the body, or to model the behaviour of bacteria and viruses in fluid surroundings. A long-standing collaboration between the Soft Matter Physics Group at The University of Edinburgh and EPCC has developed the Ludwig code for modelling complex fluids. Ludwig can represent a significant range of complexity including solid-fluid interactions, different fluid compositions, and any electric charge carried by the fluid. It can also represent active objects such as simple bacteria. This eCSE project aimed to recast elements of Ludwig to make the code more flexible and therefore able to fully exploit the capabilities of supercomputers. This will allow larger and more complex science cases to be addressed with improved efficiency on ARCHER2.

Computer simulations of fluids - which encompasses both gases and liquids - is important in many contexts. Such computations are the basis of weather and climate forecasts, and many engineering applications such as aerodynamics. At smaller scales, the same ideas can be used to study e.g., blood flow in the body, or to model the behaviour of bacteria and viruses in fluid surroundings. In some of the more complex situations (e.g., for viruses) other factors such as electric charge can become important.
 
Representing all the relevant factors in a computer simulation can then be time consuming, and require that large amounts of information must be stored and/or read from storage on disk. To make large problems tractable in reasonable time, one usually resorts to the divide-and-conquer strategy of parallel computing, where different parts of the problem are worked on separately, and the full picture is collected together as and when required.
 
This work involves a computer simulation code which is able to represent a significant range of complexity including solid-fluid interactions, different fluid compositions, and any electric charge carried by the fluid. It can also represent active objects such as simple bacteria. On large modern machines, a range of divide-and-conquer techniques may be required to provide the best performance. The work investigated different combinations of these parallel techniques and identified which ones were most effective. This will help to promote efficient computation in complex fluid systems in the future.
