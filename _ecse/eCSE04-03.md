summary: X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most important materials characterization techniques that are used in fundamental research and industrial quality control. FHI-aims is a software package for computational molecular and materials science that provides advanced XPS simulation capabilities. It is used to simulate the chemical and physical properties of atoms, molecules, nanostructures, solids, and surfaces. Such simulations allow researchers to discover new materials, which may be stronger, cheaper or more durable than existing materials.  FHI-aims can run efficiently on anything from a laptop to a supercomputer with tens of thousands of cores. However, the section of the code used for carrying out core-hole calculations was outdated and inefficient. The work done in this eCSE project has brought that part of the code up to date, so that it is now more efficient, better documented, and easier to maintain. These changes will significantly enhance the simulation of core-level spectroscopy, enabling the simulating of bigger and more detailed systems in future. The changes will also allow a much broader range of researchers to work on these types of simulations, thus ultimately enabling new scientific discoveries.

<p align="center">Highly scalable first-principles core-level spectroscopy simulations</p>


Core-hole simulations of x-ray photoelectron (XPS) or x-ray absorption spectra (XAS) are able to support the interpretation of complex experimental spectra with overlapping spectral signatures. It is therefore important to have accurate and reliable methods to calculate such spectra. While there are many different methods to do this, core-level-constrained density functional theory (DFT) calculations are the most common and computationally cost-efficient methods. The electronic structure software package FHI-aims has the functionality to perform core-hole calculations and the unique ability to provide absolute binding energy predictions due to its all-electron numeric atomic-orbital basis approach. However, the performance of the calculations suffers from both reliability and memory issues. This is due to neglected code that has not been routinely updated.

The target of this project is to completely overhaul the core-level simulation functionality and to bring it up to date with the current code framework. This has been achieved by migrating all relevant code that was strewn across several modules into one single module. The non-Aufbau Kohn-Sham orbital occupations were determined by outdated routines which caused calculations to be very memory intensive and slow due to lack of parallelisation. Code was repeated several times for different scenarios. In the redesigned code, these occupations are handled by the ELSI library, which allows for fast and memory-efficient calculations. New code has been written in the ELSI code to allow for non-Aufbau occupations needed for a core-hole calculation. All code was collected in a single easily maintained module and almost 3000 lines of redundant code were able to be deleted from the FHI-aims source code. The functionality was further enabled to be used with parallel matrix algebra, which substantially improved scalability to larger systems and on thousands of compute cores on ARCHER2.

This project will benefit the chemistry community by offering an effective way to calculate XPS and XAS for large systems such as metal-organic interfaces which were previously computationally restrictive due to poor scalability. This updated code will make it much easier for new functionality to be implemented in the code relating to core-hole simulations, with one future plan to account for relative effects for higher shell spectra.
