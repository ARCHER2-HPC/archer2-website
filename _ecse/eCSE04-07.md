summary: OptClim is a software framework that uses optimisation algorithms to tune climate models. This project has enabled use of the OptClim software on ARCHER2, and enhanced the code to work with a wide range of models. This work will reduce the uncertainty in various climate and earth system models.

<p align="center">Some weather processes  canâ€™t be fully resolved in maths, and have to be parameterised. Cloud physics is prominent in this.</p>

### Information about the code

#### OptClim2:

Code for OptClim2 is in the [ARCHER2 github branch](https://github.com/optclim/ModelOptimisation) with documentation in its wiki.

Each use for research requires added code to be tailored (to calculate simulated observables, choosing parameters...). An initial exemplar is under development in [OptClim_UKESM github](https://github.com/SimonTett/OptClim_UKESM)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Particle Filtering for UKESM:
[Github repo](https://github.com/Climate-Particle-Filtering)
 
Use of this requires also added code tailored  for the specific goals of the research 

The OptClim and the Particle Filtering code will continue to be maintained from the University of Edinburgh by this research group and be available on GitHub for others to use. We expect that others will make changes (and commit those back) to GitHub. 

Once the new PUMA service, from which UKESM models will be run, is available it will be closer in terms of security to ARCHER2.  It is expected that some relatively minor work will be needed to simplify the codes to benefit from this change.
