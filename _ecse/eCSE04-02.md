summary: ExaHyPE is an open-source simulation engine which is used for astrophysical challenges and seismic problems such as earthquake simulation. It hides most of the computing aspects from users, who need only enter the relevant scientific parameters when creating a new simulation code. This means a new simulation can be prepared in just a few hours, whereas it could take weeks, months, or even years to write from scratch. ExaHyPE is also designed to be able to exploit the future generation of exascale computers, which will have many more cores per node than current supercomputers. The need to harvest these cores makes task-based programming increasingly attractive. However, introducing tasks into codes also introduces other complexities. This eCSE project carried out modifications which have allowed the ExaHyPE code to run astrophysical simulations with unprecedented compute efficiency. As electricity costs rise and concerns grow over the environmental impact of supercomputing, there is an ever-growing focus on the need to increase the efficiency of simulation codes.

Exascale computers obtain their power from GPGPU accelerators and an explosion of their core-per-node count. For the latter reason, it is essential that modern HPC codes are able to harvest many cores. Since the classic fork-join model struggles to achieve this – there are always imbalances which lead to strong scaling effects – task-based programming is becoming increasingly attractive. With the introduction of tasks, codes however run the risk of introducing NUMA penalties, increasing the memory movements, over-synchronising threads, and continuing to suffer from fork-join imbalances if the runtime fails to use thread wait times to process pending tasks. 

We study ExaHyPE, a code employing dynamic AMR to solve wave phenomena as they describe gravitational or seismic waves. Our work proposed to introduce “manual” task queues on top of the MPI runtime, which explicitly take NUMA penalties into account and allow us to control whether a thread wait should either actively wait for its companions to terminate (to reduce the algorithmic latency) or rather process as many tasks as possible meanwhile (to increase the throughput). The introduction of smart pointers helps us to reduce the memory movements despite the additional task queues. We assume that these implementation patterns, rationale and idioms are important for a wide range of applications which have to deal with very dynamic, unpredictable workloads. In an era where the further upscaling is constrained by power, and the electricity cost of supercomputing becomes a challenge for our society, increasing the efficiency of simulation codes becomes mandatory for supercomputer users.

With the proposed alterations of the tasking runtime, the team has managed to use the ExaHyPE code to run astrophysical challenges with unprecedented compute efficiency. Furthermore, they have started to discuss the proposed challenges with the communities writing mainstream tasking runtimes. Therefore, we hope that our alterations, in the long term, might find a way into mainstream off-the-shelf software such as the OpenMP runtime.

### Information about the code


Peano is available from the [Peano website](http://www.peano-framework.org). ExaHyPE 2 is an extension to Peano which is shipped with the core repository. All modifications made due to the eCSE project are merged into the main Peano branch.

The flaws behind OpenMP and the proposed extensions are described in two ISC publications (see below). The realisation of the workarounds can be found in Peano’s technical architecture (namespace tarch/multicore). We also offer TBB, SYCL and C++ back-ends using the technologies as discussed here, though the eCSE project did focus on OpenMP.
