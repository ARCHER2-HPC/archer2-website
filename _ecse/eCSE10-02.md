summary: GeoChemFOAM is the world’s most advanced open source pore-scale numerical simulator, and is based on the widely used Computational Fluid Dynamics code OpenFOAM. GeoChemFOAM is specifically designed for research into pore-scale processes which are vital to the energy sector’s transition from fossil fuels to our Net Zero future. Applications of the code include the design and optimisation of carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy systems, hydrogen fuel cells, building materials, and nuclear waste disposal. The eCSE project carried out work on two parts of the OpenFOAM code, adapting them so that they can now make use of the memory of multiple compute nodes simultaneously. This enables researchers to carry out more complex simulations using larger datasets, allowing more sophisticated research to be carried out not only by GeoChemFOAM users, but by the entire OpenFOAM user community, estimated to number around 10,000 users worldwide.

GeoChemFOAM is the world’s most advanced open source pore-scale numerical simulator based on the widely used Computational Fluid Dynamics code OpenFOAM. It has been developed for the study of heat transfer, transport, multiphase flow, and chemical reaction in porous media and has direct applications in various fields, including energy storage, environmental remediation, and materials science. GeoChemFOAM has diverse applications in clean energy research, including:

- Hydrogen storage
- CO2 capture and storage
- Fuel cells and geothermal energy
- Upscaling permeability in reservoirs
- Contaminant transport and building materials.

The work carried out in this eCSE project will directly accelerate the ability of the scientific community to study these processes efficiently by providing them with a code that is optimised for high performance computing systems. Two previously ‘inherently serial’ routines in OpenFOAM were parallelised, resulting in the memory of multiple compute nodes now being instantly available when using the code. This will enable simulations on larger datasets to be carried out, enabling GeoChemFoam users and the wider OpenFOAM community to carry out more sophisticated research.

The work done during this project has made GeoChemFoam v5.1 and a 64-bit version of OpenFOAM centrally available on ARCHER2. Comprehensive user documentation is provided in the [GeoChemFoam wiki](https://github.com/GeoChemFoam/GeoChemFoam/wiki/GeoChemFoam-on-ARCHER2) [1], facilitating easy access and installation for all ARCHER2 users.

### Information about the code

GeoChemFoam is an open source code based on the OpenFOAM CFD toolbox. It is developed at the Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering, Heriot-Watt University. The overarching goal of the code is to simulate reactive transport in porous media applications at the pore-scale.

GeoChemFoam v5.1 is now available on ARCHER2.

For more details on GeoChemFoam, including how to run it on ARCHER2, please see the [wiki]( https://github.com/GeoChemFoam). 

ARCHER2 instructions are included in the [user wiki section]( https://github.com/GeoChemFoam/GeoChemFoam/wiki/GeoChemFoam-on-ARCHER2).
