summary: Non-equilibrium gas flows play a crucial role in various technological and scientific fields, including mass spectrometry, vacuum systems, and aerospace engineering. Specific examples include gas flows in micro-electro-mechanical systems, heat transfer for high-altitude vehicles, and gas transport in porous materials used in energy storage and filtration. However, accurately modelling these flows is particularly challenging in hypersonic aerospace applications, where turbulence, shock waves, and rarefaction interact in complex ways. This eCSE project has enhanced ASTR, an open-source high-order Computational Fluid Dynamics code for turbulence and shock research, with new modules that improve the simulation of non-equilibrium gas dynamics. These advancements will not only aid the scientific community in predicting and analysing shock waves and turbulence but also contribute to the development of more efficient space exploration technologies, improved vacuum-based manufacturing processes, and innovations in environmental monitoring, ultimately leading to advancements in energy efficiency and sustainable engineering solutions.

Non-equilibrium gas flows play a crucial role in various technological and scientific fields. However, accurately modelling these flows is particularly challenging in hypersonic aerospace applications, where turbulence, shock waves, and rarefaction interact in complex ways. This eCSE project has enhanced ASTR, an open-source high-order Computational Fluid Dynamics code for turbulence and shock research, with new modules that improve the simulation of non-equilibrium gas dynamics.

1. The primary objective of the project was the development of non-equilibrium gas flow modules within the open-source CFD software ASTR to move beyond the capability of the current Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations.
    - 1.1 The velocity-slip and temperature-jump boundary conditions have been implemented for the NSF equations for flows in the slip flow regime.
    - 1.2 The regularised 13-moment (R13) equations along with their wall boundary conditions have been implemented for flows in the slip and early transition regime.
    - 1.3 The regularised 20-moment (R20) equations have been successfully implemented for flows in the slip to mid-transition regime.
    - 1.4 The regularised 26-moment (R26) equations have been implemented for flows in the mid-transition regime based on the 2 previous implementations of R13 and R20.

2. Success at each stage has been demonstrated by validating each
implementation phase by rigorously testing the boundary conditions with
computation of flow past classic test cases in the slip, early and midtransition regimes:

    (i) Taylor Green Vortex (TGV) flows under weak rarefied condition;

    (ii) Lid driven cavity cases with 3 stationary and 1 moving solid in the slip
    and transition regime, as shown in the figure.

3. At each stage, parallel performance has been assessed to retain the
excellent scalability of the code.

4. The whole new added module and subroutines have been integrated
into the ASTR code. They will be uploaded into GitLab and merged into
the ASTR master branch.
