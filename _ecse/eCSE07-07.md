summary: Offshore renewable energy structures in the marine environment operate in harsh and inconsistent conditions. The design process for these structures must be robust, and involves extensive numerical and experimental testing. An accurate and efficient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is needed in order to capture the complex hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. The overset method for CFD models is particularly well suited to the task, but it can be computationally expensive and inefficient. This eCSE project developed a new optimised version of the open-source ESI-OpenCFD OpenFOAM overset mesh solver. In both test cases used, the computational time was reduced, and in one of the cases the model ran three times faster than before. Additionally, the new method was shown to be more efficient, running faster even when using half the number of computational nodes as before.

The marine environment in which offshore renewable structures operate is naturally subject to harsh and potentially inconsistent wind and wave conditions over the long term, posing a significant challenge to the survivability of any renewable structure and its performance. Given this, there must be a thorough and robust design process, followed by extensive numerical and experimental testing. One of the pivotal tools required at a fundamental level is an accurate and efficient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that deals with complex hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. The quality of any such model will also help ensure that the structure is as efficient as possible, both in a practical and financial sense.

The overset mesh method for CFD models has a major advantage over other techniques in that it allows for large amplitude motion of structures with complex geometries without changing its quality. This makes it particularly useful for aerodynamic analysis of fully rotating structures such as wind turbines—an application that many other methods cannot simulate. However, the primary disadvantage of the overset mesh approach is that it can be computationally expensive and inefficient.

Our eCSE work presents a new optimised version of the open-source ESI-OpenCFD OpenFOAM overset mesh solver that improves its computational efficiency. We tested the new version through two test cases. First, we considered regular wave interaction with a 2-D T-shaped floating body. It was found that the new method reduced computational time by 14% and 7% on 128 and 256 cores respectively — a modest amount but to be expected for a simple case with only small amplitude motion. Second, we considered the aerodynamics of an offshore wind-turbine rotor in constant wind. The new method reduced computational time by 64.6% on 1024 cores—approximately 3x faster whilst achieving practically identical results. The new method was also shown to have sufficiently good parallel efficiency. Indeed, the execution time on 4 nodes is less than half the time taken compared to the old method on 8 nodes, so the new method essentially cuts the required computational resources in half in addition to the reduction in computational time.

### Information about the code
 
OpenFOAM v2212 must be compiled in the user’s work directory rather than using the pre-installed Archer2 version. The cellCellStencil and inverseDistance directories in `src/overset/cellCellStencil` must then be replaced by the new versions. The stencils must then be compiled by executing ‘wclean’ and ‘wmake’ in `src/overset`. Errors may arise during compilation due to the other interpolation methods; comment out the offending lines accordingly.
