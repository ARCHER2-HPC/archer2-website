summary: The successful transition to net-zero greenhouse emissions will rely significantly on clean-energy pathway technologies, i.e., solar energy, hydrogen fuel cells and CO2 storage. To better develop these technologies, we need to understand many flow processes happening at the mesoscale, e.g., micro gas flows in hydrogen fuel cells. This requires the development of mesoscopic codes, suitable for industrial level applications and targeted towards exascale computers. This project aimed to develop the mesoscale modelling capability of Code_Saturne, an open-source, pre-exascale-ready Computational Fluid Dynamics code. A new module was implemented in the code – the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS). This numerically solves the mesoscale Boltzmann equation using a Finite Volume discretisation in the physical space and a discretised molecular velocity space. The scheme is applicable for a wide range of fluid flows and beyond, e.g., phonon heat transfer and plasma.

Many industrial transport processes may exceed the limits of continuum theory. For instance, clean
energy pathway technologies, such as fuel cells and CO2 storage in shales involve gas flows at the
micro/nano level. Some clean energy pathway technologies even extend into the quantum realm,
such as solar energy (radiative heat transfer) and neutron transfer in nuclear power plants. To
accurately address these challenges, the Boltzmann equation and/or similar transport equations need
to be solved. However, directly solving the Boltzmann equation is computationally intensive and
memory demanding. This is because the numerical solution requires discretizing the physical space
along with an additional space, the molecular velocity space. After discretizing the molecular
velocity space, the Boltzmann equation transforms into a set of scalar transport equations, solvable
only in the physical space. The number of equations increases with the Knudsen number, defined as
the ratio of the molecular mean free path to a representative length scale. Therefore, it is not
uncommon to have over 1,000 such transport equations for gas flows at the micro/nano level or at
high altitudes.

In this project, a new module, CS_DUGKS, is developed for extending the modelling capabilities of
Code_Saturne, an open-source finite volume based CFD code, to the mesoscale. To achieve this
goal, a deterministic solver of the Boltzmann equation is implemented in full. Uniform grids are
used for the discretization of the molecular velocity space, in conjunction of potential unstructured
grids in the physical space. The developed module adapts the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme for
the reconstruction of the fluxes of the distribution function at interior faces. For transient problems,
an iterative scheme is adopted in order to treat the non-linearity induced by the kinetic boundary
conditions and the imposed algebraic transformation induced to the distribution function by the
reconstruction scheme. Several test cases (cavity, Couette flows, etc. (see an example in the figure))
are carried out to demonstrate that the new CS_DUGKS is very accurate to provide the solution.
Scaling tests are performed on ARCHER2 for different mesh sizes and molecular velocity grids
including simulations of 700 million cells and 1000 molecular velocities per point, exhibiting a
nearly perfect performance up to 256 fully populated nodes of the machine.
 
### Information about the code
 
Discussions are currently happening with EDF R&D (the main developer of the whole Code_Saturne) to have a public GitHub repository linked to their official release. This is where this development will be made publicly available in the future. However, CS_DUGKS is already available to ARCHER2 community by accessing the following tarball `/work/c01/c01/shared/cs_dugks73.tar.gz`
