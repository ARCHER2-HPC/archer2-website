summary: Containerisation is the process of packaging up a computer program, and everything else required to run it. Containerisation makes it easy to transfer the program between even quite disparate computing environments, and to scale up or down in a consistent and reproducible manner, e.g. from a local cluster to a national High Performance Computing facility such as ARCHER2, or even the cloud. The user needs minimal set-up knowledge to start using the program. This eCSE project investigated the containerisation of the NEMO ocean modelling program using the open-source Singularity software (now Apptainer). The containerised version was tested on ARCHER2, and its performance was compared to the conventional method of compiling and running. The project aimed to widen access to the NEMO ocean model within the ARCHER2 user community, and to provide a template for others wishing to containerise their code on ARCHER2.

Containerisation is the process of packaging up a computer program, and everything else required to run it. In doing so the program becomes portable and easily transferable between desktop computers, High Performance Computing systems (such as ARCHER2) and even the cloud. In this study we detail a method to containerise a program of a numerical ocean model ([NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu)) and examine how well it performs compared to the conventional method of compiling and running it. For the purposes of testing, we made use of the 7km resolution Atlantic Margin Model (AMM7; Figure 1) developed at the National Oceanography Centre.  



We conducted a series of simulations: 3 conventional and 6 using the containerisation approach. Each of these used different compiler options and/or containerisation methods. The simulations were performed over a range of code optimisation levels and core counts (i.e. proportion of computer resource used to run each simulation) and their performances compared. 

Overall, the containerisation process adds up to 10% to how long the ocean model takes to run, compared to the conventional approach. For many scientific studies this may be acceptable in the face of the benefits afforded:
-	There is minimal setup knowledge required.
-	It is easily transferred between different computer systems.
-	The packaged program can be published.
-	It makes the scientific study reproducible for others.

This work will hopefully widen the access to the NEMO ocean model within the ARCHER2 user community.  It will also provide a template to for others wishing to containerise their code on the ARCHER2 system. While this approach provides an essential means to reproducible science, it can also be used to facilitate the teaching/demonstrating of ocean modelling.
