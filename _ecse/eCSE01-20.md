summary: Firedrake is an automated system for the solution of partial differential equations using the finite element method (FEM). This project improved the input/output capability of Firedrake for the running and analysis of simulations such as geophysical fluid dynamics. Other applications of Firedrake include coastal ocean simulations, weather forecasting, and marine renewable energy supply. This project also extended the HDF5 interface of the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc).

Firedrake [[1](#1)] is a high-level, high-productivity system for the specification and solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method. The core data structures used to represent solutions of PDEs are the combination of a mesh of the domain of interest and a function belonging to some discrete function space. Although computation is fully and transparently parallel once a mesh is loaded, Firedrake has lacked scalable and flexible I/O checkpointing features for meshes and functions.

In this work we enhanced the capabilities of Firedrake with respect to this weak spot by implementing a scalable and flexible parallel checkpointing infrastructure for meshes and functions using the standard HDF5 parallel file format. A crucial part of this work was the extension of the HDF5 interface of the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) [[2](#2), [3](#3)]. Firedrake relies on this interface to manage unstructured mesh data and the association of function space degrees of freedom (DoFs) with mesh topology entities, such as cells, faces, edges, and vertices. In particular, we have enhanced the capabilities of the PETSc interface so that one can save and load function space DoFs in association with mesh topology entities on different numbers of processes. These improvements to PETSc benefit the broader community of scientific software that uses PETSc datastructures, as well as Firedrake itself.

We then adopted this new PETSc implementation in Firedrake, resulting in efficient and flexible checkpointing of meshes and functions. The new interface transparently supports mesh extrusion, which is widely used for thin-domain simulations such as coastal ocean simulations, and the saving of time series solutions of time-dependent problems.

Our new checkpointing feature allows for restarting or post-processing on a number of processes appropriate to that phase of the simulation. It, for instance, benefits those who pause and resume simulations during large-scale time-dependent simulations and those who run simulations on HPC clusters and later post-process the simulation results on their workstation.
