summary: Motivation for so-called multi-scale modelling is all around us in the everyday world, where small changes at a very small scale can impact on large, system-level, engineering processes, e.g. the impact of surface degradation on the performance of a heat exchanger, or the clogging up of porous surfaces over time. The ability for computational science to bridge scales from both macro- and microscale physics to mesoscale modelling is likely to benefit a broad range of computational scientists and engineers. This project has provided two fully functional examples of coupling between popular computational macro- and microscale simulation tools (Code_Saturne and LAMMPS respectively) and the mesoscale LUMA Lattice Boltzmann code. The work lays a solid foundation for future multi-scale simulations for industrial engineering applications.

This project has made important progress in demonstrating a practical and efficient framework to enable computational science to bridge scales from both macro- and microscale physics, to mesoscale modelling, with the increasingly popular Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The primary objective of this project was to provide a highly parallel and versatile framework for the coupling of Code_Saturne, a proven pre-Exascale-ready Finite Volume Method (FVM) code, to LUMA, an efficient and versatile LBM code, in order to leverage the potential of mesoscale modelling for industrial engineering simulation. In order to prepare for full multi-scale and a 3-way coupling, we have also coupled LUMA to LAMMPS, a popular and extensive code for molecular dynamics (MD) and particle evolution simulations through the discrete element method (DEM).

The Lattice Boltzmann method is referred to as a mesoscale method on account of its ability to capture the mechanics of matter that lies between the gap of what we can see (macroscale) and what we know constitutes matter itself (microscale). Mesoscale methods are able to capture some of the physics and mechanisms of statistical mechanics in a compact and direct manner. It is very well suited to the modelling of multi-physics processes across a range of scales, as has been confirmed by the continuous success of the UK Consortium on Mesoscale Engineering Sciences (UKCOMES), a HEC Consortia formed in 2013 and renewed in 2018. Nevertheless, used alone, LBM struggles to span physical scales necessary for system-level computation, which has thus limited its use in engineering context. Indeed, usage of LBM on ARCHER2 has to date been modest. In contrast, the FVM is an excellent and highly scalable technique to simulate single-phase processes at the macro-scale with proven capabilities to meet system-scale simulation challenges. Code_Saturne is a highly capable unstructured FVM code which is massively-parallel oriented and has a strong track record on leadership-class systems. 
 
Motivation for so-called multi-scale modelling is all around us in the everyday world, where small changes at a very small scale can impact on large, system-level, engineering process, e.g.  the impact of surface degradation on performance of a heat exchanger, or clogging-up over time of porous surfaces. In coupling the LBM method to the popular MD and DEM software (LAMMPS) we have demonstrated the potential for LBM to act as a bridge from macro to microscale simulation. This work provides first steps and much more physics can be incorporated to truly explore its potential.
