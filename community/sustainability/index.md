We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint within the ARCHER2 service and contributing to the University of Edinburghâ€™s commitment to being zero carbon by 2040. An essential component of the ARCHER2 service is travel: travel for teaching; collaboration; and reporting.

However this is also a significant source of carbon emissions. The ARCHER2 service will therefore look to reduce our carbon emissions by choosing the most carbon efficient modes of transport and to offset our carbon emissions through the use of carbon offset schemes.
