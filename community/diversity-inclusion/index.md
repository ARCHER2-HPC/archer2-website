EPCC and ARCHER have taken a leadership role in encouraging Diversity in HPC, having founded [Women in HPC](https://womeninhpc.org) and now running the UK Women in HPC Chapter, and having developed the [Diversity in HPC web site](http://www.hpc-diversity.ac.uk/) with a range of people profiles to celebrate diversity in our community. 
 
Under ARCHER2, we will continue with our commitment to enhancing diversity through a series of activities in areas such as: diversity within the ARCHER2 service; encouraging diversity through outreach; celebrating diversity; and Women in HPC.
 
* **Diversity within ARCHER2**: We have developed a Diversity and Inclusion policy that will be central to the ARCHER2 service and will be widely promoted to the community. The policy can be found on our [Service Policies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/policies/). 
 
* **Equality Impact Assessments**: ARCHER2 staff are trained to complete Equality Impact Assessments and ensure that assessments are made where appropriate, in line with our [Diversity and Inclusion policy]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/policies/diversity-inclusion.html).
 
* **Diversity through Outreach**: We will tailor a set of events and workshops to diverse communities, e.g., we will run workshops targeted at primary school girls to encourage their engagement in computational science and offer lifelong learning opportunities to engage with wide sections of the community. Further details will appear on the ARCHER2 [Discover and Learn page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/outreach/). 
 
* **Women in HPC**: We will continue to run and expand the Women in HPC Chapter. We will represent the UK at international events, engaging in workshops and BoFs at events such as SC and ISC. See the [Women in HPC website](https://womeninhpc.org) for more information.
