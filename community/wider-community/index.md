The ARCHER2 service has a range of opportunities to engage with the wider community. In particular, we will support a local charity and offer support for local community organisations. 
We will do so in the following ways:
 
*	**Work Experience Programme**: This will provide secondary school children with the opportunity to carry out a week's work experience.
*	**Charity Support**: Throughout the lifetime of the service we will support a local charity. We commit to survey the user community on an annual basis, seeking feedback on the service. To encourage participation, for every response received, we will donate money to the Service’s chosen charity. 
*	**Community Support**: We will have a small budget to support local community organisations, such as local sports clubs and community clubs. Organisations will be able to request funding (of order £200-£300) to help fund events and initiatives that help improve social well-being in the community.
