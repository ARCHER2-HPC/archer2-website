<b> Note: </b> <I>The National Federated Compute Services Network+ involves staff from the ARCHER2 team but it is not an ARCHER2 project. ARCHER2 have agreed to host the webpages while we develop the project's website.</I></p>

The National Federated Compute Services Network+ aims to build collaboration and knowledge exchange for federating across the stakeholder communities that use and provide computational services. A key objective is to produce a roadmap for the future of federated compute services in the UK.

An important component of the NetworkPlus is the distribution of funding to support the building of community and contributing to the development of the roadmap. Approximately Â£2m of total funding is available for short term projects built around the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Governance, Technology, and Community.

The project lead team are: Jon Hays (Queen Mary University London), Sadaf Alum (University of Bristol), Josephine Beech-Brandt (EPCC, University of Edinburgh), Adrian Hines (JASMIN, STFC) and Aassil Alexandrov (Hartree, STFC). 

## Flexible Funding Call 

We invite applications for the flexible funding call. The Flexible Funding call is designed to support projects that:
(a) collect relevant evidence and documentation to contribute to the development of the federation roadmaps; 
(b) contribute to building the community around NFCS. 

The flexible nature of the call will enable the selection of projects on various scales that span the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Community, Technology, and Governance. The selection of projects will seek to achieve a balance across these pillars and between large and small projects. The Flexible Funding call is the principal mechanism through which the community can contribute to developing the insights needed for the roadmaps, and the project selection will look to ensure that a range of communities of different sizes and maturities with respect to large-scale computing and data services are engaged.  

### Flexible Funding Call Process

Applicants are strongly recommended to engage with the NetworkPlus lead team, as early as possible, prior to final submission for feedback to ensure good alignment with the scope of the call. We will endeavour to respond to all enquiries made before <b> 22nd April. </b>

Further details are available within the full Flexible Funding Call document: [Flexible Funding Call ](NFCS_FF_Application.docx)
