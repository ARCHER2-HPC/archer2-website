The National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus aims to build collaboration and knowledge exchange for federating across the stakeholder communities that use and provide computational services. A key objective is to produce a roadmap for the future of federated compute services in the UK.

An important component of the NetworkPlus is the distribution of funding to support the building of community and contributing to the development of the roadmap. Approximately £2m of total funding is available for short term projects built around the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Governance, Technology, and Community.

The project lead team are: Jon Hays (Queen Mary University London), Sadaf Alum (University of Bristol), Josephine Beech-Brandt (EPCC, University of Edinburgh), Adrian Hines (JASMIN, STFC) and Aassil Alexandrov (Hartree, STFC).
