The [National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus](https://nfcs-networkplus.ac.uk/) aims to build collaboration and knowledge exchange for federating across the stakeholder communities that use and provide computational services. A key objective is to produce a roadmap for the future of federated compute services in the UK.

An important component of the NetworkPlus is the distribution of funding to support the building of community and contributing to the development of the roadmap. Approximately £2m of total funding is available for short term projects built around the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Governance, Technology, and Community.

The project lead team are: Jon Hays (PI, Queen Mary University London), Sadaf Alum (University of Bristol), Josephine Beech-Brandt (EPCC, University of Edinburgh), Adrian Hines (JASMIN, STFC) and Aassil Alexandrov (Hartree, STFC). The team is supported by John Masih (Project Manager), Rui Apóstolo (Community Enagement), David Meredith (Industry Engagement) and will be joined by a project administrator and a technical coordinator.  

## National Federated Compute Services Flexible Funding Call 

We invite applications for the flexible funding call. The Flexible Funding call is designed to support projects that:
(a) Collect relevant evidence and documentation to contribute to the development of the federation roadmaps;
(b) Contribute to building the DRI community around NFCS.

The flexible nature of the call will enable the selection of projects on various scales that span the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Community, Technology, and Governance. The selection of projects will seek to achieve a balance across these pillars and between large and small projects. The Flexible Funding call is the principal mechanism through which the community can contribute to developing the insights needed for the roadmaps, and the project selection will look to ensure that a range of communities of different sizes and maturities with respect to large-scale computing and data services are engaged.  


### Flexible Funding Call Process

Applicants are strongly recommended to engage with the NetworkPlus lead team, as early as possible, prior to final submission for feedback to ensure good alignment with the scope of the call. We will endeavour to respond to all enquiries made before the <b> 22th of September.</b>

All the information about this, as well as the relevant documents and application forms, can be found on our [website](https://nfcs-networkplus.ac.uk/).

## Autumn Conference 2025

Are you a Digital Research Infrastructure user or provider wondering where you'll be on 22–23 September?

If you're interested in helping us shape a national federation of compute services and the opportunities this will create, then join us at our second national event.

This will be a stimulating combination of expert plenaries and focussed experience sharing and problem-solving across a broad agenda including:

 - Edge federation
 - Data movement and management
 - Inter/transnational collaboration
 - The transition from laptop to cluster
 - Identity and access management
 - HPC for non-traditional users

The Conference will also provide an opportunity for partnership building for the programme's second call for DRI Roadmap projects.

You can check the timetable and register [here](https://indico.ph.qmul.ac.uk/event/2299/overview).
