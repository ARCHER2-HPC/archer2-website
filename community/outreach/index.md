## Why Outreach?

The aim of the ARCHER 2 public engagement is to demonstrate to people across the UK the relevance of high performance computing (HPC) and how everyone benefits from it. In particular, we want to convince young people, who otherwise might not think so, that STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers are open to them. To achieve this we will do the following:
*	Generate impact at large science festivals around the UK, such as the Big Bang Fair and New Scientist Live
*	Attend multiple smaller (local) events including school visits and careers events
*	Provide online materials accessible on demand
*	Offer work experience for high school students

All ARCHER2â€™s outreach activities will be carried by experienced staff who work in HPC and data science technical, managerial, and training roles. Staff are from a range of different scientific disciplines, and work on a wide range of projects, so can offer a range of perspectives on STEM careers.
