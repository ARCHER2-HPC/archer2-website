The launch event for the UKRI NetworkPlus on National Federated Compute Services (NFCS+) is a two-day event and will take place on 5th and 6th March 2025, starting at 10:00 AM GMT, at One Moorgate Place, London, EC2R 6EA (remote participation is available). 

The National Federated Compute Services NetworkPlus aims to build collaboration and knowledge exchange for federating across the stakeholder communities that use and provide computational services. A key objective is to produce a roadmap for the future of federated compute services in the UK.

An important component of the NetworkPlus is the distribution of funding to support the building of community and contributing to the development of the roadmap. Approximately £2m of total funding is available for short term projects built around the three pillars of the NetworkPlus: Governance, Technology, and Community.

<b>Day 1: Knowledge Exchange </b>
The first day focuses on exploring the purpose of the NetworkPlus and federation. It will include an introduction to the project and its goals and objectives followed by invited talks from community federation projects. 
This will be followed by breakout sessions focusing on the three pillars for NFCS+ : Governance, Technology and Community.

<b>Day 2: Networking and Community Building </b>
The second day is focused on building networks and community, in the context of the three pillars and exploring ideas for projects that might attract funding to support the goals of the NetworkPlus. As well as sharing ideas, this will also provide the opportunity to meet with potential future collaborators.

Registration for the event is now closed. 
We may consider late registrations for remote attendance and if you would like to be considered please email info@epcc.ed.ac.uk stating that you would like to be considered for remote attendance at the NFCS.  

A draft agenda and the flexible funding call will be added to this page shortly.
