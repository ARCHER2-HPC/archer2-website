The launch event for the UKRI NetworkPlus on National Federated Compute Services (NFCS+) was a two-day event and took place on 5th and 6th March 2025, starting at 10:00 AM GMT, at One Moorgate Place, London, EC2R 6EA (remote participation was available). 

<b>Day 1: Knowledge Exchange </b>
The first day focuses on exploring the purpose of the NetworkPlus and federation. It included an introduction to the project and its goals and objectives followed by invited talks from community federation projects. 
This was followed by breakout sessions focusing on the three pillars for NFCS+ : Governance, Technology and Community.

<b>Day 2: Networking and Community Building </b>
The second day was focused on building networks and community, in the context of the three pillars and exploring ideas for projects that might attract funding to support the goals of the NetworkPlus. As well as sharing ideas, it also provided the opportunity to meet with potential future collaborators.
