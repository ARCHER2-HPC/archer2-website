### 1 Insight into the Correlated Disorder of Fumarate-Based MIL-53 Frameworks: A Computational Study of Free-Energy Landscapes 
Chi Cheng (Cecilia) Hong, University of Edinburgh 

As the effects of climate change become more apparent in the form of rising global temperatures, the necessity for temperature control become more significant. Current refrigerants are low cost and work extremely efficiently but these materials possess very high global warming potentials. A greener alternative is a solid-state approach via barocaloric materials which exhibit large adiabatic temperature and isothermal entropy changes upon compression and decompression cycles.
