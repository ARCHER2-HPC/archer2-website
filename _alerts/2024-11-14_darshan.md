scope: All parallel jobs launched using srun
impact: All parallel jobs launched using `srun` will have their IO profile captured by the <a href="https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/data-tools/darshan/">Darshan</a> IO profiling tool. In rare cases this may cause jobs to fail or impact performance. Users can disable Darshan by adding the line `module remove darshan` before they use `srun` in their job submission scripts.
reason: Capturing data on the IO use on ARCHER2 to improve the service.
