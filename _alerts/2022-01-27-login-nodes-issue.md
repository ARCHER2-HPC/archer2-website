status: Open
type: Issue
start_date: 2022-01-27 14:30:00
end_date: 
scope: login and serial nodes
impact: Unfortunately, an issue on the ARCHER2 login nodes and data analysis nodes has meant that they have had to be reconfigured. This would have led to a loss of connection to ARCHER2 for any logged in users, an inability to login for users that were not connected, and jobs running on the data analysis nodes ("serial") partition would have failed.<br>
We are in the process of bringing the nodes back into service and they should be available again around 15:05 today.<br>
Apologies for any inconvenience caused. 
reason: Systems team are investigating
