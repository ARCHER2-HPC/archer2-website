scope: login and serial nodes
impact: Unfortunately, an issue on the ARCHER2 login nodes and data analysis nodes  meant that they have had to be reconfigured. This led to a loss of connection to ARCHER2 for any logged in users, an inability to login for users that were not connected, and jobs running on the data analysis nodes ("serial") partition failed.<br>We have now restored both login and serial nodes to normal service.<br>Apologies for any inconvenience caused. 
reason: Systems team are investigating
