status: Resolved
type: At-Risk
start_date: 2024-05-20 10:00 
end_date: 2024-05-25
scope: ARCHER2 Nodes
impact: A rolling-reboot to update the compute nodes on ARCHER2 which includes the newer CPE (Cray Programming Environment) 23.09. This will not impact running work but once jobs finish, compute nodes will be rebooted and then be returned to service with the new updated software. Serial work is unaffected.
Reason: Installation of newer CPE (Cray Programming Environment) 23.09
