scope: A hardware issue with one of the ARCHER2 worker nodes has caused a number of the compute nodes to go into 'completing' mode. These compute nodes require a reboot. 
impact: Some compute nodes are unavailable as reboots are performed. Some user jobs will not complete fully and other may fail. These jobs should not be charged but please contact support@archer2.ac.uk if you want to confirm whether a refund is required.     
reason: Hardware issue with a worker node.
