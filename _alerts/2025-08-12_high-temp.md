status: Planned
type: Service Alert
start_date: 2025-08-12 12:00
end_date: 2025-08-14 09:00
scope: Reduced number of compute nodes 
impact: Increased queue times and reduced node availability
reason: We are monitoring the cooling closely during unusually forecasted high temperatures in the Edinburgh area. We have stopped new jobs from starting and powering off nodes until the cooling is within operating limits. Jobs will start to run again on a subset of nodes from 2200 on Wednesday 13 August. We anticipate having a full service available again on Thursday 14 August.
