status: Planned
type: Service Alert
start_date: 2025-06-20 11:00
end_date: 2025-06-21 09:00
scope: 40% - 50% Compute nodes
impact: Increased queue times and reduced node availability
reason: We have powered down 40% of compute nodes to ensure cooling is adequate due to unusually high temperatures in the Edinburgh area.  We have placed a further 10% of compute nodes into maintenance mode. The maintenance will be lifted at 2200 on Saturday 21st June if cooling is at a good level. A further assessment will take place at 0900 on Sunday 22nd June and if possible nodes will be returned to service. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by longer queue times.
