status: Planned
type: Service Alert
start_date: 2025-06-20 11:00
end_date: 2025-06-20 21:00
scope: Compute nodes
impact: Increased queue times and reduced node availability
reason: A reduction of around 40% of compute nodes to ensure cooling is adequate for compute nodes as higher temperatures are forecast in the Edinburgh area.  We currently have stopped new jobs starting to obtain the 40% limit but once the cooling system is stable, new jobs will start.
