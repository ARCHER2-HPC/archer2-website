scope: The Slurm batch scheduler will be updated to include the GPU nodes.
impact: Running jobs will not be impacted and users will be able to submit new jobs. However, there will be several interruptions to the slurm scheduler which means that new jobs will not start. If users are impacted, you should wait a few minutes and then try to resubmit the job again.   
reason: Updating the Slurm configuration.
