status: Ongoing
type: Service Alert
start_date: 2024-04-25 09:30 
end_date: 2024-04-25  
scope: Serial Nodes, DVN01 and DVN02   
impact: Users will not be able to use the serial nodes. This means members of n02 will not be able to run jobs as their workflow depends on the serial nodes. We appreciate this is both critical and urgent for this project and HPE are investigating.   
reason: The heavy load on the metadata server may have impacted the slurm controller and caused the slurm deamon to fail on these nodes. Investigation is ongoing.
