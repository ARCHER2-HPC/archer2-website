type: Issue
start_date: 2021-11-03 14:45:00
end_date: 2021-11-03 14:45:00
scope: 4-cabinet system login access
impact: The login-4c.archer2.ac.uk address is unreachable so logins via this address will fail, users can use the address 193.62.216.1 instead
reason: A short network outage at the University of Edinburgh caused issues with resolving the ARCHER2 login host names
