status: Resolved
type: Issue
start_date: 2022-10-05 09:00
end_date: 2022-10-17 13:15
scope: Slingshot interconnect
impact: Some jobs may fail with MPI errors (e.g. "No route to host", "pmi_init failure"), the larger the number of nodes used in the job, the more likely users are to hit the issue. A reboot of Slingshot is planned for Mon 17 Oct 2022 - see maintenance table below for details.
reason: A number of active optical cable links between groups in the interconnect topology are not working
