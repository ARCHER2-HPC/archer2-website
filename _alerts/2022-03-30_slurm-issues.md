scope: Slurm scheduler
impact: Users may see issues with submitting jobs&colon; `Batch job submission failed&colon; Requested node configuration is not available` and `srun&colon; error&colon; Unable to create step for job 1351277&colon; More processors requested than permitted` which will see jobs not submit or fail at runtime.
reason: Part of this morning's update has been rolled back and we believe this issue is thus now resolved.
