bio: Oleksandr did PhD in plant biomechanics studying wind influence on plants. Since then, he worked at the University of Glasgow as research assistant and research associate investigating secondary currents in turbulent flows over heterogeneous surfaces using direct numerical simulations. His research interests range from turbulent flows over complex surfaces to bluff body aerodynamics and plant biomechanics. Outside of work, he enjoys exploring nature and running.
