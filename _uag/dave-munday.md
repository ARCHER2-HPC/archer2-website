bio: Dave is a physical oceanographer and numerical modeller at the British Antarctic Survey. He studied Ocean Sciences at the University of Southampton and Weather, Climate & Modelling at the University of Reading. Daveâ€™s PhD is in the dynamics of western boundary currents and their flow separation. He now works predominately on the Southern Ocean and Antarctic Circumpolar Current, specialising in the use of idealised numerical models to understand their circulation and dynamics. He has a long standing interest in palaeocean circulation and carbon cycling over geological timescales due to the tectonic rearrangement of continents and the opening of ocean gateways, e.g. Drake Passage or Tasman Seaway.
