bio: Dr Diana Suleimenova is a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Brunel University of London. Her research concentrates on agent-based modelling, forced displacement prediction, and verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) of multiscale applications deployed on emerging exascale platforms. Her work also led to a range of international collaborations on developing and analysing the sensitivities of new forced displacement models. She is co-Chair of the Multiscale Modelling and Simulation workshop and a Knowledge Exchange coordinator for the Software Environment for Actionable and VVUQ-evaluated Applications (SEAVEA), which aims to develop an exascale-ready toolkit for verification, validation and uncertainty quantification techniques in application to various domains.
