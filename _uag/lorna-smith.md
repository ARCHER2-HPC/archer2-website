bio: As the CSE Service deputy director, I tend to be involved in most aspects of the service delivery. However I have a particular role within the eCSE programme, around documentation, outreach and understanding and monitoring emissions as we look towards Net Zero services.  Out with work you can find me in my garden or enjoying the chaos of being a Beaver Scout leader.
