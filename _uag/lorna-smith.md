bio: As the CSE Service deputy director, I tend to be involved in most aspects of the service delivery. However I have a particular role within the eCSE programme, around the web site, documentation, compliance, outreach and understanding and monitoring emissions as we look towards Net Zero services. Out with work you can find me poolside as a qualified swimming judge, playing my saxophone or attacking ivy in my garden.
