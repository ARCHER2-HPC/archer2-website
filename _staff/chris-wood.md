bio: Since joining EPCC in 2018, I’ve been involved in a number of eCSE projects, with a particular interest in supporting users from the environmental and life sciences domains. I’m a course organiser on the MSc that we run, as well as being involved in lecturing on a range of other MSc modules and ARCHER2 training courses, and have recently been awarded a NERC training grant. I also help manage aspects of the ARCHER2 outreach programme, to help explain to the public why ARCHER2 is so important.
