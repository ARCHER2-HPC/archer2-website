bio: I joined EPCC in November 2023 as an Applications Developer after completing my MSc in HPC with Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. I was also a part of the winning ISC Student Cluster Competition team, TeamEPCC 2023. To continue my interests in HPC developed through the MSc and the competition, I joined EPCC, where I'm involved in various industry and research work. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking and playing MOBA games.
