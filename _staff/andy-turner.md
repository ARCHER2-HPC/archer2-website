bio: My main role as CSE Architect in the ARCHER2 service is to try to make the service as useful as possible for researchers. I help the team prioritise work to improve the service and try to anticipate future requirements for researchers on ARCHER2. I strongly believe that we can achieve more in research by working together openly in a collegial way and so think that having strong links between the ARCHER2 service and the wider community are vital; and where the critical mass of the ARCHER2 service can have a large impact. To help achieve this I try to maintain strong links with various organisations, such as the <a href="https://society-rse.org/">Society of Research Software Engineering</a>, the UK <a href="https://hpc-sig.org.uk/">HPC-SIG</a>, <a href="https://www.dirac.ac.uk">DiRAC</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> and various user communities. In my spare time, I can be generally be found out in the countryside somewhere&colon; either under it (caving), over it (bikepacking) or though it (wild swimming).
