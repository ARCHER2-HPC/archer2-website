## eCSE Programme Overview

Through a series of regular calls, Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner, to run on the ARCHER2 system, or to prepare for a future Exascale successor. Projects targeting a future GPU platform are welcome, as are projects looking at any aspect of preparing the ARCHER2 software stack for Exascale. Note projects that only target improvements for existing platforms (other than ARCHER2), rather than preparing for future Exascale systems, are not in scope. 

The funding allows the employment of a Research Software Engineer (RSE) to carry out software development of ARCHER2 software, or work targeting a future Exascale successor. This development work may include but is not limited to the implementation of algorithmic improvements, improvements to scalability, portability, sustainability or maintainability, or may include the addition of new functionality to a code which in turn will allow new science to be carried out. For work targeting future Exascale systems, this may include but is not limited to GPU development, improvements to the resiliency of the code, or improvements to parallelisation or I/O likely to be required at Exascale.

The RSE may be based at the institution of the PI, at a third party institution, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team, or the project may use a mixture of the above.
