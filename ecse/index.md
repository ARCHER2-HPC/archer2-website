## eCSE Programme Overview

Through a series of regular calls, Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to improve research on the ARCHER2 service. The funding allows the employment of a Research Software Engineer (RSE) to carry out software development of ARCHER2 software. This development work may include the implementation of algorithmic improvements, improvements to scalability, portability, sustainability or maintainability, or may include the addition of new functionality to a code which in turn will allow new science to be carried out.

The RSE may be based at the institution of the PI, at a third party institution, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team, or the project may use a mixture of the above.

## Current Call Information

Together with UKRI we have agreed to delay the first eCSE call to match better with the updated ARCHER2 hardware timetable.

We are pleased to announce that the first ARCHER2 eCSE call will open on **19th May 2020**. The deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluations is **16th June 2020**, with the final deadline for proposal submission being **7th July 2020**. 

Further details on the [eCSE Calls page](calls/).
