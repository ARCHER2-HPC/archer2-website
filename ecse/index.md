## [GPU eCSE software development calls](calls/)

We are very pleased to announce a new programme of eCSE calls focussing on GPU development. GPU eCSE support provides funding to the UKRI research community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on GPU-based architectures. We invite proposals to develop software that facilitates research targeted at UKRI’s digital research infrastructure e.g. future Exascale supercomputing services, UK national AI services, national Tier-2 HPC services. The call is open to research across all of UKRI’s remit. The 2nd GPU eCSE call (GPU-eCSE02) opened on the **2 July 2024**. The final deadline for proposal submission is **16:00 on 17 Sep 2024** via the ARCHER2 SAFE. Plese see the [GPU eCSE call information](calls/) for further information.


## ARCHER2 eCSE software development calls

Through a series of regular calls, Embedded CSE (eCSE) support has provided funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner, to run on the ARCHER2 system, and more recently to prepare for a future Exascale successor.

There are currently no ARCHER2 eCSE calls open but please do take a look at [recently completed projects](reports/)

## eCSE Observers call

One of the aims of the eCSE programme is to provide support for researchers in the early stages of their careers and we will be offering a small number of early career researchers the opportunity to attend the eCSE panel meeting as observers. 

There is currently no eCSE Observers call open.


## Upcoming eCSE Calls

Note future dates are provisional and subject to change depending on earlier demand and future funding.
