### Observers Call

The eCSE Panel Meeting is the meeting where eCSE proposals are reviewed and decisions are made on which proposals to fund. As part of our commitment to encouraging and developing Early Career Researchers, we are offering a small number of places to such researchers to attend the eCSE panel meeting as Early Career Observers. The aim is to give Early Career Researchers a better insight into this competitive selection process, to assist them in the preparation of future funding proposals

The deadline for applying to attend the panel meeting as an observer is 16:00 on 4 Oct 2022.

## How to Apply

To apply to attend an eCSE Panel Meeting as an observer you should send a completed Early Career eCSE Panel Observer
[application form](ARCHER2_eCSE08_EarlyCareerObserver_ApplicationForm.docx), together with a copy of your CV, to the ARCHER2 service desk:
[support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk).

Applications will be evaluated based on the quality of the case made by the applicant, and the extent to which the reviewers agree that the applicant is an early career researcher.

Successful candidates will be chosen to attend this meeting (expected to be between mid-November and early December) or a later meeting, depending on space and availability.

Panel meetings usually last most of a day (e.g. starting at 9:15 and continuing until mid-afternoon or starting mid-morning and continuing until 16:30). Observers must therefore be able to commit most of a day to attending the meeting.

Panel Observers will need to agree to the same conflict of interest process and confidentiality requirements as full panel members.

## Early Career Researchers

Applicants are expected to hold a PhD or have equivalent research experience.

There are no specific eligibility requirements based on number of years of post-doctoral research experience

Consideration will be given to applicants who have taken a non-standard career path after their primary degree.

Applications are also welcomed from candidates who wish to re-establish themselves after a career break or other period of absence from active research.


## Call deadline

Deadline for applications: 16:00 on 4 Oct 2022. Applications received after the deadline cannot be accepted.
