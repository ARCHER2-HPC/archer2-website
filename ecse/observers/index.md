## Observers Call

The eCSE panel meeting is the meeting that reviews eCSE proposals and
decides on which proposals to fund. As part of our commitment to
encouraging and developing Early Career Researchers, we will be
offering a small number of early career researchers the opportunity to
attend the eCSE panel meeting as observers. The aim here is to give
early career researchers a better insight into this competitive
selection process to assist in the preparation of funding proposals.

The deadline for applying to attend the panel meeting as an observer
is 16:00 on 6 Oct 2020. Both the application form and the CV should be
sent to the ARCHER2 service desk:
[support@archer2.ac.uk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk)

## How to Apply

To apply to attend an eCSE panel as an observer you should send a
completed Early Career eCSE Panel Observer <a
href="ARCHER2_eCSE02_EarlyCareerObserver_ApplicationForm.docx">application
form</a> together with a copy of your CV to the ARCHER2
service desk. Successful applicants will be invited to attend the panel
meeting. You will need to agree to the same conflict of interest
process and confidentiality requirements as full panel members.

The panel meeting is likely to be held between mid-November and early December 2020. The exact date will be confirmed later whereupon successful candidates will be chosen according to space and availability.

## Call deadline

Deadline for applications: 16:00 on 6 Oct 2020. Applications received
