## The 1st ARCHER2 eCSE call

The 1st ARCHER2 eCSE call (ARCHER2 eCSE01) opened on the 19 May 2020. The
deadline for submitting documents for technical evaluations is **16:00 on 16 June
2020**, with the final deadline for proposal submission being **16:00 on 7 July
2020**.

Please note that the process for applying for an eCSE project under
ARCHER2 has been updated since ARCHER eCSE programme. In particular,
there is now a 2-stage submission where technical evaluation documents
must be submitted for evaluation by the first deadline above in
advance of the final submission. Any project members (PI, Co-I and
technical staff) must have been invited by the proposal owner to join
a project and have accepted the invitation in time for the final
submission. Proposals cannot be submitted without technical staff.

submitting a proposal</a> to this call, along with <a

### Scope

Through a series of regular calls, Embedded CSE (eCSE) support
provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in
a sustainable manner, to run on the ARCHER2 system.

Funding will enable the employment of a Research Software Engineer
(RSE) to work specifically on the relevant software to enable new
features or improve the performance of the code. Examples of this
could be

* Implementation of algorithmic improvements within an existing code
  in a portable manner

* Improving the scalability of software on higher core counts in a
  portable manner

* Improving a code to enhance sustainability and maintainability

* Improvements to code that allow new science to be carried out on
  ARCHER2

* Porting and optimising a code to run efficiently on ARCHER2

* Adding new functionalities to existing codes

* Code development to take a code from a Tier-2 (Regional) or local
  university cluster to ARCHER 2

Note that projects to develop software on the GPU hardware component
of ARCHER2 are not within the remit of this call.

### Funding and eligibility

Funding is provided for software which results in research which is
within the remit of EPSRC. Please note funding for this call does not
include research in the remit of NERC. Funding can be requested for
staff located at the institution of the PI, third parties, or can
include staff from the centralised CSE support team or a mixture of
the above. Funding can be requested for between 3 and 12 person months
in total. Staff employed on an eCSE project are expected to play a
full part in ARCHER2 related activities.

Reasonable travel will be funded for travel within the UK to meetings
with other project partners.

When submitting your proposal, all costs must be included in your
submission. Please ensure your budget is accurate and inclusive of all
costs before submission and that you provide a costing
breakdown. Please see the guidance document for details of allowable
costs and associated documents.

### Computing Resources

Successful projects will be given an allocation of resources on
ARCHER2 when it becomes available. The size of this allocation will be
determined when the system itself becomes available.

### Training

Regular training will be provided via the CSE team. Details of
upcoming training course can be found [here](../../training/).

### Application and Review Process

Information and guidelines on how to apply for eCSE funding can be
found <a
href="ARCHER2_eCSE01_ApplicationGuidance.pdf">here</a>. Proposals
undergo a two-stage process. A technical evaluation is performed first
with completed forms being passed back to applicants in time for
including in the final submission. After final submission, all
proposal documents, including the completed technical evaluation
forms, will then be passed to the review panel who will make decisions
on ranking and any award of funding.

The eCSE applications should be submitted via SAFE. The eCSE technical
evaluation form can be found <a
href="ARCHER2_eCSE01_TechnicalEvaluation.docx">here</a> and the
proposal template can be found <a
href="ARCHER2_eCSE01_ProposalTemplate.docx">here</a>.

### Reports and eCSE staff requirements

A detailed technical report is required at the end of the project. A
template is provided for the report will be made available on the
ARCHER2 website. Upon conclusion of the project, in addition to the
detailed technical section, a section aimed at the non-specialist is
required explaining the aims and successes of the project together
with the scientific and any other impacts of the work. PIs and/or
project technical staff are expected to give a least one webinar of
the work achieved.

### Intellectual Property

IPR will belong to the project, although the expectation is that any
EPSRC-funded code development will be made available to the wider
community via a new release of the software.

### Acknowledging ARCHER2

You should use the following phrase to acknowledge ARCHER2 in all
research outputs that have used the facility and the eCSE Programme:

This work was funded under the embedded CSE programme of the ARCHER2
UK National Supercomputing Service (http://www.archer2.ac.uk).

You should also tag outputs with the keyword ARCHER2 whenever
possible.

### Contact

The ARCHER2 CSE team can be contacted via the ARCHER2 service desk.
