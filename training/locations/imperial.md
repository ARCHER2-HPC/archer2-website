The nearest Underground station is South Kensington. If you’re arriving by Underground, go to the right after you pass through the ticket barriers at South Kensington station, following the signs for “Museums” which leads you into a long pedestrian subway. Continue to the very end of the subway and turn left at the top of the stairs. After a short distance you will see the campus entrance on your left.

Enter the campus via the Imperial College Road entrance, passing alongside the car park. Take the diagonal path across Dangoor Plaza (alongside Queen’s Tower) to reach the entrance to the Sherfield Building.
