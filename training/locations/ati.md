# The Alan Turing Institute London


The Alan Turing Institute is located on the first floor of the British Library.
You will need to enter via the public entrance of the British Library, which is open from 9:30am. Please note that there can be a long queue to enter the Library at 9:30am so we recommend arriving early to get in to the queue. The Institute is located on the first floor.

It is not possible to take luggage in to The Alan Turing Institute due to security restrictions at the British Library. It would therefore be necessary to leave luggage at e.g. the Left Luggage office at King's Cross railway station which is very close by.

## Address

The Alan Turing Institute,
2QR,
96 Euston Rd,
London

The course will be held in 'Enigma' (the Institute's events space).
