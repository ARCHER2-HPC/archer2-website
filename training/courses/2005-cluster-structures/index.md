Piero Ferrari will be presenting his work completed under the HPC-Europa3 Transnational Access programme

In clusters, particles composed of just a countable number of atoms, all physical and chemical properties depend strongly on size. In many cases, adding a single atom can drastically modify properties such as stability, chemical reactivity or magnetism, which is a consequence of a fine interplay between geometry and electronic structure. 

Therefore, determining the precise geometry of a cluster is a fundamental step towards an understanding of the size-dependent properties of these particles, and possibly, for their use in applications. In this talk, a method able to determine the geometries of clusters will be discussed, which combines infrared spectroscopy experiments performed at free electron facilities, with density functional theory calculations. As a model system to illustrate this method, the structures of gold and palladium doped gold clusters will be presented.
