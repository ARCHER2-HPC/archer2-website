SUMMARY:ARCHER2: EPCC early experiences from the test and development platform 
URL:https%3A%2F%2Feu.bbcollab.com%2Fguest%2F6ada2b42557941d5b15e961af4c7cd26
DESCRIPTION:Join link : https://eu.bbcollab.com/guest/6ada2b42557941d5b15e961af4c7cd26\n\nAndy Turner\, EPCC\n\nEPCC have recently had remote access to the ARCHER2 test and development system (TDS) installed in the HPE Cray factory in the US. This is a small system (just 8 compute nodes) with an early version of the Shasta software stack. We have been using this access to prepare for the full ARCHER2 service - configuring the system\, testing processes\, testing system software and porting software. In this webinar\, I will present our experience so far with the TDS with a particular focus on topics of interest to users\, including: software available\, scheduler and job submission scripts\, porting software and initial performance data.\n
