## Novice package user without HPC expertise



Virat is a PhD student working in materials science research. He has been told by his supervisor that he will be using CASTEP on ARCHER2 for the research project. He has played around with using the command line before but has no experience of accessing remote HPC resources, using batch submission systems or running parallel software. He feels unsure about where to start with accessing and using ARCHER2 and is concerned that he will waste the projectâ€™s ARCHER2 resources by getting things wrong when he uses the system.
