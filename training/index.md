If you would like us to provide a course on a particular topic and/or in a particular location then please contact us via the [ARCHER2 Service Desk](../support-access/servicedesk.html).

Individual links to course provide more details on the content and prerequisites. Use the <em>Register Link</em> to sign up for a particular course.

### New Training Course registration process 

During November 2024 We are moving to a [new Registration process](../news/2024/11/19/training-registration.html), so registration is done within SAFE, and the account request in the correct project is now part of the approval process, done automatically by the system.

Documentation for this new process can be found in our [SAFE Docs](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/training-registrations/)

Please do not hesitate to contact the [Service Desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk) if you have any questions or experience any issues with the new process.
