The ARCHER2 Driving Test is an online assessment tool which allows those new to ARCHER2 to demonstrate that they are sufficiently familiar with ARCHER2 and HPC to start making use of it.  

It is suitable for anyone who has completed an Introduction to ARCHER2 training course (or [followed the material online](#online-introductory-course-materials)), or for users of other HPC systems who have familiarised themselves with the specifics of running jobs on ARCHER2 by reading up the appropriate preparation material resources.


On successful completion of the Driving Test, eligible users will be invited to apply for an account on ARCHER2 and awarded a small allowance of 800 CUs to use to run jobs over a period of up to 12 months.  This will also allow access to the uncharged GPU nodes.

This scheme is intended to promote access to HPC to new users and communities who would not otherwise be able to gain initial experience on HPC systems. In particular we hope to give a head start to potential future ARCHER2 users. Applicants would normally be resident in the UK, perhaps with an existing connection to a research institution such as those listed at [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/howtoapply/fundingguide/eligibility/organisations/](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/howtoapply/fundingguide/eligibility/organisations/). However, if you feel you fall outwith this group, please do get in touch with [training@epcc.ed.ac.uk](mailto:training@epcc.ed.ac.uk) to discuss whether we can help. Only one Driving Test account application per person is permitted as it is intended for new users to gain first-time, hands-on experience.

The Driving Test is intended for academics and non-academic researchers working in UK based research institutions within sectors related to the remits of the ARCHER2 partner research councils for pre-competitive computational research runs. The final decision on awarding access to ARCHER2 remains with the service. 

## Online Introductory Course Materials

- [The Hitchhikers' Guide to ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220302-hitchhikers-guide/) - a one-hour webinar video and slides, which provides an overview of the system's hardware and software and covers basic usage such as logging in, compiling code, and running jobs.

Recent course runs with videos and materials available which will provide appropriate preparation for taking the Driving Test:
- [ARCHER2 for Package Users](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/211202-package-users/)
<!--- [ARCHER2 for Data Scientists](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220228-data-scientists/) -->
- [ARCHER2 for Software Developers](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/220131-software-developers/)

## Take the ARCHER2 Driving Test


Two versions of the ARCHER2 Driving Test are available - they are of equal difficulty but have some different questions appropriate to each type of user.  Please attempt whichever test best matches your use.

- [ARCHER2 Driving Test for Software Developers](http://www.quia.com/quiz/8151812.html)

## GPU Driving Test

The GPU Driving test includes questions relating to the use of the [ARCHER2 AMD GPU Development Platform
](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/gpu/) 

- [Take the ARCHER2 GPU Driving Test](https://www.quia.com/quiz/8519232.html)

On successful completion of the GPU Driving Test, eligible users will be invited to apply for an account on ARCHER2 and awarded a minimal allocation (10 CUs) which will allow the running of uncharged jobs on the GPU nodes over a period of up to 12 months.

If you require a greater number of CPUs, please use one of the original Driving Test options as they include access to the GPUs.

Please note that all completed tests are checked manually by a member of the Training team. <br/>
We try to do this, and get back to you, within **4 working days**. If you have not heard from us after 5 days please get in touch via the [ARCHER2 Service desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk).<br/>
If you have passed you will receive an email with a certificate and, if eligible, an invitation to sign up for an ARCHER2 account.
