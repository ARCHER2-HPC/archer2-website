At Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC), our mission is to raise awareness and address issues around diversity and inclusion within the HPC community and workforce. Lack of diversity in the workforce is a challenge that the entire supercomputing industry faces. Research shows that diverse teams increase productivity, idea generation, problem-solving and scientific output, so addressing the lack of diversity should be as important to the community as the push for exascale.

As a founding member of WHPC, EPCC has seen the organisation grow to have representation in 5 continents, over 30 chapters and affiliates community-level groups, official collaborations with prolific international conferences and we are still gaining momentum! In this session, we'll introduce you to WHPC, outlining who we are, what we do, and how you can become involved in driving the positive change you wish to see in your community.



This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
