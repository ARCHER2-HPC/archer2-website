In a nuclear power plant, the prediction of fluid flow and heat transfer is of vital importance for the plant's performance and for safety compliance. This course will focus on the use of CFD for the prediction of fluid flow and heat transfer.

The course will run for 2 half days split over 2 days comprising a mixture of lectures and tutorials. The open-source HPC software Code_Saturne will be used by the participants to run large scale simulations using the UK national facility ARCHER2.

The course is suitable for PhD students, postdocs and engineers who have limited knowledge in HPC/Nuclear thermal hydraulics but are interested in gaining experience in this area.

The course is free to attend, but spaces are limited to 20.

### Prerequisites:
Use of Linux command lines, Basic knowledge of programming.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct](../../code-of-conduct/). 


This course is organised by CCP-NTH/UKTC in association with ARCHER2 and PRACE.
