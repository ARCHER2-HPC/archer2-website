#### Description:

This course will continue on from the [ARCHER2 for Package Users course on 7th December](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/231207-package-users/) and will focus on the 

-     What does the ARCHER2 application development environment look like and how do I use it?



#### Target Audience:

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for user who:

-     have already completed the [ARCHER2 for Package Users](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/231207-package-users/) course
-     have already used other HPC systems; and
-     want to compile (and possibly) develop HPC software on ARCHER2.


#### Prerequisites:

You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line. You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using scp). Finally, you should be comfortable with compiling parallel HPC source code that uses MPI and OpenMP.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
