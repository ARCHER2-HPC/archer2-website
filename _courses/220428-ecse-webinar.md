Through a series of regular calls, [Embedded CSE (eCSE) support](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/calls/) provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to improve research on the ARCHER2 service. The funding allows the employment of a Research Software Engineer (RSE) to carry out software development of ARCHER2 software within the EPSRC remits. Calls are issued 3 times per year.

The [seventh eCSE call](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/calls/) is presently open and closes at 16:00 on 14th June 2022 with technical evaluation documents due to the service desk by 16:00 on 24th May 2022.

This eCSE Webinar will provide an overview of the eCSE programme, examples of work carried out during eCSE projects, and will describe the submission process including all the technical and logistical aspects of putting together a proposal. There will be the opportunity to ask questions about any aspect of the programme.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
