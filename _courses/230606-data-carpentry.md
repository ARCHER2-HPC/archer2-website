[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/)  workshops will focus on introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. It is ideal training for researchers wishing to learn how to use open source tools to make their research open and reproducible. you do not need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This is a 2-day workshop, you need to available on both days in order to get a place.

### Aims and objectives

This two day workshop will cover:

-    using spreadsheets effectively
-    using OpenRefine for data cleaning
-    an introduction to R: including data analysis & visualisation
-    data management with SQL


This workshop uses a [tabular ecology dataset](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/data/index.html) from the [Portal Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459) and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualization. *There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools*. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher would use.


### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
