#### Location:

This course will run online.

#### Goals

This workshop is organised by VI-HPS for the ARCHER2 service and the UK PRACE Advanced Training Centre to:

- give an overview of the VI-HPS programming tools suite
- explain the functionality of individual tools, and how to use them effectively
- offer hands-on experience and expert assistance using the tools

On completion participants should be familiar with common performance analysis and diagnosis techniques and how they can be employed in practice (on a range of HPC systems). Those who prepared their own application test cases will have been coached in the tuning of their measurement and analysis, and provided optimization suggestions.
Programme Overview

Presentations and hands-on sessions are on the following topics:

- Paraver/Dimemas (BSC)
- TAU (UOregon)
- Score-P/Scalasca/Cube (JSC)
- MAQAO (UVSQ)
- ARM Forge (ARM)

A brief overview of the capabilities of these and associated tools is provided in the VI-HPS Tools Guide.

The workshop will be held in English and run from 09:00 to not later than 17:00 each day, with breaks for lunch and refreshments. There is no fee for participation.


#### Outline

The workshop introduces tools that provide a practical basis for portable performance analysis of parallel application execution, covering both profiling and tracing. It will be delivered as a series of presentations with associated hands-on practical exercises using the ARM-based Isambard Cray XC50 computer.

While analysis of provided example codes will be used to guide the class through the relevant steps and familiarise with usage of the tools, coaching will also be available to assist participants to analyse their own parallel application codes and may suggest opportunities for improving their execution performance and scalability.
