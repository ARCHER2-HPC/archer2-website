The webinar describes the porting of software to help researchers to respond to uncertainty in climate and Earth-system models in two ways. Firstly, OptClim software permits researchers to optimise parameters in three prominent earth system models: CESM, MITgcm-based models and UKESM.  Secondly we have developed closely-related software for “particle filtering” (PF) in which an ensemble of UKESM runs is used to track historical data.

The webinar will:
-	Explain the rationale for the OPTCLIM and PF software
-	Outline its porting to ARCHER2 and the extensions that tailored the system for MITgcm, CESM and UKESM models.
-	Introduce GeosMeta, a system previously developed for capturing metadata and provenance, and explain how it was used with UKESM and its own workflow server as a message-passing service.
-	Orient potential users.

*Some weather processes can’t be fully resolved in maths, and have to be parameterised. Cloud physics is prominent in this.*

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
