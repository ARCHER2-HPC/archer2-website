#### Location:

This course will take place face-to-face at  [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.location_url }})

This course will not be streamed online and a recording will not be made.

#### Description: 

This course focused on Xcompact3d which is a Fortran-based framework of high-order finite-difference flow solvers dedicated to the study of turbulent flows. Dedicated to Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES) for which the largest turbulent scales are simulated, it can combine the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes. Its user-friendliness, simplicity, versatility, accuracy, scalability, portability and efficiency makes it an attractive tool for the Computational Fluid Dynamics community. It is one of the four flagship solvers of the UK Turbulence Consortium. The course will run for 1 day comprising a mixture of lectures and tutorials. 

#### Target Audience:

The course is suitable for PhD students, postdocs and engineers who have limited knowledge in HPC, CFD and turbulence but are interested in gaining experience in these areas.

The course is free to attend, but spaces are limited.

#### Prerequisites:

Use of Linux command lines, Basic knowledge of programming in modern Fortran.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
