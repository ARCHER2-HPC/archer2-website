### Outline

Data Analytics refers to the manipulation, processing and analysis of data. In recent years, this area has undergone a revolution in which HPC has been a key driver. This one-day intermediate course provides an overview of data science and the analytical techniques that form its basis as well as exploring how HPC provides the power that has driven their adoption.

#### Learning outcomes

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

* How can I read tabular data?
* How can I do statistical analysis of tabular data?
* How can I plot my data? How can I save my plot for publishing?
* How can I benefit from HPC?

#### Pre-requisites

To attend, you must have some experience of writing code and/or scripts and be familiar with programming concepts including conditionals, loops, arrays and functions. You should also have some basic knowledge of the Python language. For an introduction to Python, please see Code Academy's Python tutorial ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)) or the Software Carpentry's lesson on Python ([https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/))

You should also be comfortable with using the bash shell. For an introduction to the shell, please see, for example Software Carpentry's lessons on Unix Shell: [https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

We strongly recommend you download, before the course, Anaconda Python version 3 from [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct](../../code-of-conduct/). 


#### Timetable:

Detailed Timetable will be published soon.

The course will run 10:00 - 16:00 GMT on 11th November 2020

There will be a follow-up consultancy session on 15th December, 15:00 - 16:00 GMT
