[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.

Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

The workshop will cover:

- (Monday morning) Data Organization in Spreadsheets. OpenRefine for Data Cleaning.
- (Monday afternoon) Introduction to R.
- (Tuesday morning) Continuation of R: Data analysis and Visualization.
- (Tuesday afternoon) Data Management with SQL.

### Requirements:

Participants must have access to a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
