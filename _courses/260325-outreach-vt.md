Outreach enables the sustainable growth of any community: it showcases the value of the work, explains why it matters, and attracts diverse new talent. This is particularly important in high performance computing (HPC), a field that most people don't encounter directly in their everyday lives.

The ARCHER2 Outreach team delivers both our own outreach and works to strengthen and connect the outreach community itself, sharing our expertise to support the people who make HPC engagement happen.

By bringing practitioners together at conferences and events, we help develop a more collective, sustainable ecosystem for outreach delivery, widening participation and sharing good practice across the community.

Alongside this, we also engage directly with a wonderfully wide range of audiences, from pre-school children to students, researchers, and the general public, through interactive and hands-on activities at science fairs, in classrooms, and in training environments. All of which are designed to teach the fundamentals of what we do: supercomputing! 

This interactive webinar will showcase the breadth of ARCHER2 outreach activities, demonstrating how HPC can be made accessible, engaging, and fun. Join us to explore our VR headset, learn about spintronics, and, of course, experience the all-time favourite: parallel sock sorting!
