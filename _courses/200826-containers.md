It is anticipated that there will be an uptake in the use of containers for running research codes.
It is hoped that containers will facilitate reproducibility and portability.

You may see a paper that presents some intriguing results produced by a numerical simulation.
The paper references a definition file, allowing you to build the container (within which the research code runs) and deploy to a HPC platform of your choice. You find that you can reproduce the results.
You then tweak the input settings to explore a number of what-if scenarios and in effect stand on the shoulders of the author(s).

Is this expectation realistic? I will present my attempts to run various research codes within containers on two HPC platforms, Cirrus and CSD3. Where possible, I investigate whether or not there is a performance penalty incurred by running containerised software. 


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
