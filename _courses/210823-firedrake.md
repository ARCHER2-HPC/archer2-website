#### Aims

This course will introduce users to Firedrake, an automated system for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM).


Participants will get hands on experience:

- Writing the weak form of a PDE in UFL (domain specific language for expressing finite element problems)
- Solving a range of different PDEs using Firedrake
- Configuring solvers and preconditioners for HPC
- Running Firedrake in a HPC environment on ARCHER2


#### Target Audience:

This course is aimed at researchers who have no (or very little)
previous experience of using Firedrake, but are familiar (or have at
least previously used) some HPC facility before

#### Prerequisites:

- Familiarity with the command line (BASH)
- Comfortable writing Python code
- Some knowledge of the finite element method

#### Requirements:

Participants should use a computer with a web browser for accessing the training material and working through the cloud based Jupyter notebooks.

The computer must also be capable of connecting to ARCHER2 via an SSH connection.

Familiarity with using a text editor on a remote system. Some participants may already be happy using Emacs or Vim on the remote system, or some other text editor. If this is not the case there will be instructions provided for working with Visual Studio Code.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

#### Timetable:

23rd August 2021 13:00 - 17:00 BST (12:00 - 16:00 UTC)
