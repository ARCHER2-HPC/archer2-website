The HPC community has always considered the training of new and existing HPC practitioners to be of high importance to its growth. The significance of training will increase even further in the era of Exascale when HPC encompasses even more scientific disciplines. This diversification of HPC practitioners challenges the traditional training approaches, which are not able to satisfy the specific needs of users, often coming from non-traditionally HPC disciplines and only interested in learning a particular set of skills. HPC centres are struggling to identify and overcome the gaps in users' knowledge. 

How should we support prospective and existing users who are not aware of their own knowledge gaps?

The goals of the [HPC Certification Forum](https://www.hpc-certification.org/about/) are:

* Standardizing the HPC knowledge representation into fine-grained competences
* Establishing international recognized certificates attesting knowledge
* Supporting an ecosystem around the HPC competences
 
This talk introduces the [HPC Certification Forum](https://www.hpc-certification.org/about/) and gives an overview of its activities and status.

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
