#### Location:

This course will take place face-to-face at  [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.location_url }})

This course will not be streamed online and a recording will not be made.

#### Overview

Scalasca/Score-P is a portable, free and open-source software toolset
that supports the performance optimisation of parallel programs by
measuring and analysing their runtime behaviour.  The analysis
identifies potential performance bottlenecks – in particular those
concerning communication and synchronisation – and offers guidance in
exploring their causes.  Scalasca uses execution profiles and traces
generated by the community-developed Score-P instrumentation and
measurement infrastructure.

Scalasca/Score-P targets scientific and engineering applications based
on the programming interfaces MPI and OpenMP/OpenACC, including hybrid
applications combining both with kernel offload to GPU accelerators.
The tool has been specifically designed for use on large-scale systems,
but is also well suited for small and medium-scale HPC platforms.  The
software is available for free download under the New BSD open-source
license.

This in-person course will cover how to use the tools in practice,
delivered by members of the development team.  Scalasca/Score-P is
portable across HPC systems, but for this course practical exercises
will be conducted on the GPU-enabled partition of the UK National HPC
Service ARCHER2 (an HPE/Cray EX system); all attendees will be given
accounts on ARCHER2 for the duration of the course.  Although example
parallel programs will be provided, attendees are encouraged to analyse
the performance of their own applications.  

Access to ARCHER2 will be
available before the course starts to port and build applications; those
who are unfamiliar with ARCHER2-GPU programming are encouraged to view the [recording of the recent webinar ARCHER2 GPUs](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/240131-archer2-gpus-vt/)



### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
