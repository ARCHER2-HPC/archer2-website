High-performance computation (HPC) is central to modern  astronomy. Moreover, the diversity of astronomy as a science results  in models with very different computational requirements. 

In this  presentation, I will show-case three representative astrophysical  problems which strongly rely on HPC in different ways. These include  the models of how mergers of white dwarf stars may lead to type 1a  supernovae, which are among the brightest explosions in the universe;  simulations of binary stars with a detailed stellar evolution code,  which demonstrate how these stars trace the history of our Galaxy; and  finally, the evolution of triple stars, for which using correct models  of stellar interactions make a substantial effect on their present-day orbits.

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
