#### Overview

Data Analytics, Data Science and Big Data are a just a few of the many terms used in business and academic research, all referring to the manipulation, processing and analysis of data. Fundamentally, these are all concerned with the extraction of knowledge from data that can be used for competitive advantage or to provide scientific insight. In recent years, this area has undergone a revolution in which HPC has been a key driver. This course provides an overview of data science and the analytical techniques that form its basis as well as exploring how HPC provides the power that has driven their adoption. The course will cover: key data analytical techniques such as, classification, optimisation, and unsupervised learning; key parallel patterns, such as Map Reduce, for implementing analytical techniques; relevant HPC and data infrastructures; case studies from academia and business.
