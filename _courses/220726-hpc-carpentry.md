This course introduces accessing remote advanced computing facilities via the command line and High Performance Computing (HPC). After completing this course, participants will:

* Understand motivations for using HPC in research.
* Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops.
* Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data.
* Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems.
* Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system.
* Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software.
* Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource.

**Prerequisites:**
There are no prerequisites for this workshop.

**Requirements**
Participants must use a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. You will need a bash shell. They are also required to abide by [ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/code-of-conduct/).


## Day 1 Attendance

Day 1 will cover the HPC Shell.  If you are already familiar with using ssh connections and confident using the bash shell then you can choose not to attend Day 1 as long as you ensure that you are able to log on to ARCHER2 using your course account beforehand.  Please note that you will not be attending Day 1 on the Registration form, under "Any other Information".

If you are confident using the bash shell but have any issues with connecting to ARCHER2 using your course account, you must attend the first part of Day 1 up to the point of achieving a successful connection.  Support will not be available on Day 2 for making your first connection to ARCHER2.
