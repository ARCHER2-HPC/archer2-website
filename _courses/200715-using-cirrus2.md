Cirrus is a UK Tier 2 service funded by EPSRC and is aimed at users with computational requirements that fall between University-level resources, and the National Service Archer.

An upgraded Cirrus system was returned to service in June with a number of significant changes. The Cirrus service consists of

* 280 standard compute nodes each with Intel Xeon (Broadwell) 36 cores
256 GB
* 36 new GPU nodes each housing 4 NVIDIA V100s

This talk will give an overview of the important features of the new system, including

* How to get access to Cirrus
* Logging in and the user environment
* Submitting jobs using the Slurm scheduling system and queue policy
* Using the GPU nodes

and will be of interest to both new users and existing users wanting to refresh their knowledge of the system.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
