This lesson provides an overview of some more advanced techniques and uses of LAMMPS. Specifically, we will be discussing:

- Measuring and improving LAMMPS performance
    - Strong vs weak scaling for a range of systems
    - Smarter domain decomposition
    - Accelerators and what they do
- Using LAMMPS with Python
- Analysing systems through reruns
- Advanced sampling methods with a focus on replica exchange
- 
#### Target Audience:

For this lesson, we expect attendees to be familiar with LAMMPS. We will not be covering how to prepare and run a parallel LAMMPS simulation (and we will assume that all attendees know how to do this already). This lesson is aimed at anyone who:

- has experience using `bash` (or any other shell)
- has experience running LAMMPS on multiple processors
- would like to learn more about some of the LAMMPS functionalities stated above
- would like to learn more about tricks and methods for getting LAMMPS to perform efficiently.


### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
