This workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to understand how to port, execute and optimize applications for the ARCHER2 GPU Test and Development platform.

The workshop is a mixture of lectures and practical hands-on sessions. Example exercises will be provided but attendees are encouraged to bring their own application and a session is reserved where attendees can concentrate on their own applications.

Specific topics that will be covered include:

- System Architecture.
- Compiling and running applications on AMD GPUs (Programming Environment, compilers, scientific libraries, Slurm).
- OpenACC and OpenMP offloading with the Cray PE.
- GPU programming with HIP.
- Application profiling and debugging on GPUs.

#### Target Audience:

It is expected that attendees are familiar with the ARCHER2 environment but may not be familiar with systems having nodes with accelerators.  The course will not teach GPU programming but will outline how to build and run applications using different programming models.

**As places on this course are limited, priority will be given to existing ARCHER2 users.  Please include your ARCHER2 username in the "Additional information" part of the registration form.**


### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
