Predicting fluid flow and heat transfer is vital to many industries, such as energy, food and aerospace, for instance. This course will focus on the use of CFD for the prediction of fluid flow and heat transfer, and present some of the integrated features of Code_Saturne to prepare for massively parallel simulations on tier-0 machines.

The course will run for 2 half days split over 2 days comprising a mixture of lectures and tutorials. The open-source HPC software Code_Saturne will be used by the participants to run large scale simulations using the UK national facility ARCHER2.

### Target audience:

The course is suitable for PhD students, postdocs and engineers who have limited knowledge in HPC, CFD and Nuclear thermal hydraulics but are interested in gaining experience in these areas.

The course is free to attend, but spaces are limited.

### Prerequisites:

Use of Linux command lines, Basic knowledge of programming.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html). 

This course is organised by CCP-NTH/UKTC in association with ARCHER2 and PRACE.
