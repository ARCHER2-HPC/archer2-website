Room 34/2003 - Seminar Room,<br>
Building 34 Education,<br>
University Road<br>
Highfield Campus<br>
SO17 1BJ

This course will not be streamed online and a recording will not be made.

#### Target Audience:

This two-day course introduces accessing remote advanced computing facilities via the command line and High Performance Computing (HPC). The first day will introduce how to use the shell in a HPC context. The second day will cover how to use HPC systems effectively. Please note that the first day is optional in case you're already familiar with the shell.

After completing this course, participants will:

-     Understand motivations for using HPC in research.
-     Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops.
-     Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data.
-     Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems.
-     Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system.
-     Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software.
-     Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource.

##### Day 1 Attendance

Day 1 will cover the UNIX command line (also known as terminal or shell) to operate a computer, connect to a remote HPC system, and write simple shell scripts. If you are already familiar with using SSH connections and confident using the Bash shell then you can choose not to attend Day 1 as long as you ensure that you are able to log on to ARCHER2 using your course account beforehand.

**Please note if you will not be attending Day 1 on the Registration form, under “Any other Information”**.

If you are confident using the Bash shell but have any issues with connecting to ARCHER2 using your course account, you must attend the first part of Day 1 up to the point of achieving a successful connection. Support will not be available on Day 2 for making your first connection to ARCHER2.

#### Prerequisites:

There are no prerequisites for this workshop.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.).

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html). 


#### Timetable:
