This lesson provides an overview of some more advanced techniques and uses of LAMMPS. Specifically, we will be discussing:

- Measuring and improving LAMMPS performance:
  - Strong vs weak scaling for a range of systems.
  - Smarter domain decomposition.
  - Accelerators, and what they do.
- Running LAMMPS from Python.
- Analysing systems through reruns.
- Advanced sampling methods with a focus on replica exchange.

For this lesson, we expect attendees to be familiar with LAMMPS. We will not be covering how to prepare and run a parallel LAMMPS simulation (and we will assume that all attendees know how to do this already). This lesson is aimed at anyone who:

- Has experience using bash.
- Has experience running LAMMPS on multiple processors.
- Would like to learn more about some of the LAMMPS functionalities stated above.
- Would like to learn more about tricks and methods for getting LAMMPS to perform efficiently.


### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html). 


#### Timetable:

09:30 - 16:30
