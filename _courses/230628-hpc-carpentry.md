This one-day course introduces accessing remote advanced computing facilities via the command line and High Performance Computing (HPC).

After completing this course, participants will:

-     Understand motivations for using HPC in research.
-     Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops.
-     Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data.
-     Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems.
-     Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system.
-     Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software.
-     Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource.

#### Target Audience:

#### Prerequisites:

Bash shell: use the UNIX command line (also known as terminal or shell) to operate a computer, connect to a remote HPC system, and write simple shell scripts.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.
