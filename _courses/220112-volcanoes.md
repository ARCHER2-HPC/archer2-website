In the event of a volcanic eruption it is vital to be able to predict the spread of ash and gas. This is particularly challenging near to the eruption site, and when the eruption occurs in a region with a high degree of geographical complexity, such as Iceland. This presentation will describe some of the basics of modelling volcanic plume dispersion. From simplified models of volcanic plumes and how they are affected by winds, to highly complex simulations that capture the spread of volcanic gases across Iceland, ARCHER2 has been used to simulate volcanic plume behaviour. Such simulations were used actively in the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption. An emergency allocation was granted on ARCHER2 and simulations were performed operationally and shared with colleagues in Iceland.
