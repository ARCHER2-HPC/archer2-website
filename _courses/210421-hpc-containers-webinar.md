We regret that we have to CANCEL this webinar.  We hope to be able to run a webinar on this topic at some point in the future but we are unable to set a date at this time.



Containers are a convenient means of encapsulating complex software environments, but can
this convenience be realised for parallel research codes?

Running such codes costs money, which means that code performance is often tuned to specific
supercomputer platforms. Therefore, for containers to be useful in the world of HPC, it must be
possible to capture this specialisation within a single container. Indeed a container should be
dedicated to one research code and have the ability to run efficiently on multiple HPC platforms.

This presentation will explore a workflow that attempts to achieve this aim using Singularity
containers based on the bind model.



This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
