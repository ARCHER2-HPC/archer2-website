#### Course Description

[Scalasca](https://www.scalasca.org/) is a software tool that supports the performance optimization of parallel programs by measuring and analyzing their runtime behaviour. It uses execution profiles and traces generated by the community-developed Score-P instrumentation and measurement infrastructure. The analysis identifies potential performance bottlenecks – in particular those concerning communication and synchronization – and offers guidance in exploring their causes.

[Scalasca](https://www.scalasca.org/) targets mainly scientific and engineering applications based on the programming interfaces MPI and OpenMP, including hybrid applications based on a combination of the two. The tool has been specifically designed for use on large-scale systems, but is also well suited for small- and medium-scale HPC platforms. The software is available for free download under the New BSD open-source license.

This course will cover how to use the tools in practice, delivered by members of their development team. Practical exercises will be conducted on the UK National HPC Service ARCHER2, an HPC Cray EX system; attendees will be given accounts on ARCHER2 for the duration of the course. Although example parallel programs will be provided, attendees are encouraged to analyse the performance of their own applications on ARCHER2. Those who are unfamiliar with building and running their applications on ARCHER2 are recommended to attend the course “Introduction to ARCHER2 for Software Developers” or view its [recordings](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/221202-software-developers/#videos) in the training materials archive.


### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2  Code of Conduct](../../../about/policies/code-of-conduct.html). 


### Timetable:
