The UK biomolecular simulation community has come together to characterise a number of the key proteins within the virus in an effort identify targets for vaccines and antivirals. We will provide a brief overview of these activities before focusing on studying the binding site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
 
The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus known as
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite extensive research
since the outset of the pandemic it continues to spread with a high mortality rate. The main
protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an enzyme essential for virus replication through viral
proteolytic activity and subsequent generation of infectious virus particles. Current computational
efforts towards SARS-CoV-2MPro inhibitor design have often failed to consider the disruption of the 
His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad as a possible mechanism,  and thus missed the opportunity to target the open
conformational state. In this presentation, we use molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations to sample  this conformational change. We calculate a 1 +/- 0:45 kcal/mol free energy difference between the open and closed states of the SARS-CoV-2MPro active site. This
indicates that favourable interactions with His41 over the Cys145-His41 dyad interaction
can stabilise the open state, and that this state should be considered as part of inhibitor design efforts.



This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
