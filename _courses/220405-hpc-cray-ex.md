#### Overview:

This three day workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to understand the most optimal way to port, execute and optimize applications for ARCHER2.  The workshop is a mixture of lectures and practical hands-on sessions.  Example exercises will be provided but attendees are encouraged to bring their own applications.

Specific topics that will be covered include:
* Cray EX System Architecture
* Compiling and running applications ( Programming Environment, compilers, libraries, Slurm )
* Debugging tools
* Application profiling 
* Optimization of applications for serial performance, parallel execution and efficient use of I/O

*This is an opportunity to learn about the system hardware and software architecture, direct from HPE Cray Centre of Excellence experts, and we do not expect to be able to repeat this opportunity in the near future.  No recordings will be provided so we encourage you to sign up now to ensure your place.*

#### Prerequisites:

Although the first day is of a more introductory nature it is expected that attendees are proficient Linux users, are familiar with HPC system environments in general and have a good understanding of parallel programming in C/Fortran.

### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.

They are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct](../../code-of-conduct/). 

This course is open to users of ARCHER2. 

This course will not be recorded and the materials will be shared only with the participants.

### Timetable:



#### Day 1: Introduction to the ARCHER2 architecture and software.

- Introduction to the Cray Hardware and Programming Environment.
- Overview of compilers and libraries
- Advanced Job Launching

#### Day 2: Deep dive on compilation and profiling.

- Introduction to Perftools
- Advanced performance analysis
- Performance Optimization: Improving single-core efficiency
- Debugging at scale

#### Day 3: Deep dive on MPI and IO. You will also have the opportunity to compile your code on ARCHER2.

- Understanding Cray MPI
- Rank reordering and MPMD application launch
- IO Optimization - Parallel I/O

There will be morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks. 
There will be a mixture between lessons and hands-on exercises.
