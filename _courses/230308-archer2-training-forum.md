Do you want to take part in the development of the next ARCHER2 training programme? 

Please join our next ARCHER2 Training Forum meeting, which will take place online at 3pm on Wednesday, 8th March 2023. 

- What courses would you like to attend? 
- What courses would you like to include? 
- Have your say!

The ARCHER2 training programme is designed every year based on feedback from previous course attendees, the ARCHER2 training forum and the ARCHER2 training panel. The ARCHER2 training forum is formed by the ARCHER2 Service Director, the ARCHER2 training function lead, the EPCC Director of Education, and representatives from the [EPSRC HEC Consortia and NERC Consortia](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/research/consortia/), among others.

In order to give the opportunity for anyone to express their feedback on the draft for the upcoming training year (May 2023 - April 2024), the ARCHER2 Training Forum meeting will be public. The meeting will not be recorded, although the outcomes will be published on the event page.

The agenda will be:
* 15:00-15:10 - Introduction and presentation of the training programme draft.
* 15:10:15:40 - Open discussion.

We look forward to hearing from you. If you canâ€™t attend the meeting, please feel free to contact us via the [ARCHER2 service desk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html) and let us know what you think about the ARCHER2 training service.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
