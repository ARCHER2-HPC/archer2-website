We ran a webinar last week to introduce the [ARCHER2 full system](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/211117-archer2-full-system/) and the recording and slides from that webinar are available. 

Now that users have access to the ARCHER2 full service, we will be running a drop-in session on Wednesday 1st December from 14:00-16:00, where members of the ARCHER2 support team will be on hand to answer questions about the ARCHER2 full system and transferring data from the 4-cabinet system to the full system. 

We're aware that switching to a new system can be complicated, and we will be on-hand throughout this webinar to answer questions, provide advice, and hear feedback from the ARCHER2 community about this process.

Drop in at any point during the session - it is not expected to attend the full two hours.

This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
