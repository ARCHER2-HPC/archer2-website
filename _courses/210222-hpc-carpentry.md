* Understand motivations for using HPC in research.
* Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops.
* Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data.
* Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems.
* Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system.
* Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software.
* Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource.

**Prerequisites:**
There are no prerequisites for this workshop.

**Requirements**
Participants must use a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. You will need a bash shell.
