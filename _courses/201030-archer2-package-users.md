#### Description:


The lesson aims to answer the following questions:
* What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
    * What does they consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
    * How does this impact me as a user?
* How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
* What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
* How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
* How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
* How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
* What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?



#### Target Audience:

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for user who:
* have already used other HPC systems; and
* want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

#### Prerequisites:

You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting 
using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line. You 
should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them on your 
local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using scp).

#### Requirements:

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that 
they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed [here](https://epcced.github.io/20201030-archer2-intro-package/#setup)). They 
are also required to abide by the [ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct](../../code-of-conduct/).
