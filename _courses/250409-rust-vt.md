Prof Timo Betcke, Professor of Computational Mathematics and Associate Director, UCL Centre for Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

Rust is an exciting programming language. Within 10 years of its 1.0 release it has found its ways into Android, the Windows Kernel, cloud computing, and many other domains.

But is it ready for the HPC Challenge? Three years ago we started off with 0 lines of code and the desire to develop a scalable Galerkin Boundary Element Code for ARCHER2. The caveat,

we wanted to make it work in Rust. In this talk we give a breakdown of this journey, discuss things that worked really well in Rust, and other things that did not work so well.

While the talk itself is not a Rust tutorial we want to give a realistic expectation of what expects those who want to do Rust at scale.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
