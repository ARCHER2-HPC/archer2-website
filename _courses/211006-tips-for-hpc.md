With the advent of the new ARCHER2 service it seemed like a good time to canvass opinion from EPCC on their top tips for getting the most out of HPC resources. In this webinar I will cover the top ten (and maybe more) tips from EPCC staff on using HPC resources based on their personal experience and their experience of supporting a wide range of users on HPC systems. There will be plenty of time for discussion after the presentation so please do bring along your own tips and we can add them to the list.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
