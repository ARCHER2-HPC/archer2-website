This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:

-     have already used other HPC systems; and
-     want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:

-     What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
-     What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
-     How does this impact me as a user?
-     How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
-     What does the ARCHER2 software environment look like and how do I access software?
-     How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
-     How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
-     How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
-     What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?
