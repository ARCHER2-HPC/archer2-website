LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is a widely-used classical 
molecular dynamics (MD) code. This C++ code is easy to use, incredibly versatile, and parallelised 
to run efficiently on both small-scale personal computers and CPU/GPU/CPU&GPU HPC clusters. As of 2018, 
LAMMPS has been used, to some degree, in over 14,000 publications in fields as varied as chemistry, 
physics, material science, granular and lubricated-granular flow, etc.

The course will be run over three 2.5 hour-long sessions. 

The first session will be 
an introduction to setting up and running an MD simulation using LAMMPS. We will begin 
by running a simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid before delving deeper into how simulations 
can be set up and run in LAMMPS. 

In the second session, we will discuss how to download and 
install LAMMPS, with a more in-depth discussion of the various packages LAMMPS offers and how 
to use them efficiently.

The third session will be a follow-up session for exercises, discussion and questions.

## Computing requirements

All attendees will need their own desktop or laptop .

If you are logging on to an external system then you will need to have an ssh client installed which comes as default for Linux and Mac systems.

Linux users should open a command-line terminal and use ssh from the command line.

Mac can open the Mac termimal application and use ssh from the command line. However, 
to display graphics from Cirrus you will also need to install [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). Xquartz provides its own terminal called "Xterm": if you have problems displaying graphics when using the Mac terminal, try logging in using ssh from within this Xterm.

Windows users should install [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) which provides ssh access, a Unix graphics client and a drag-and-drop file browser.

We will provide accounts on one of our HPC services, for all attendees who register in advance at [http://www.archer.ac.uk/training/registration/](http://www.archer.ac.uk/training/registration/).
