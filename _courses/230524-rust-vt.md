Prof Timo Betcke, Professor of Computational Mathematics and Associate Director, UCL Centre for Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

Since its first stable release in 2015 Rust has seen tremendous adoption as a modern alternative to C++.
Rust has an advanced and very expressive type system. Its ownership rules and other novel features
prevent many of the memory errors that plague C++ development, and its modern tooling system means
that Rust code can be built and easily deployed using very simple and short configuration files. It is thus natural to
ask if Rust is there yet for serious scientific computing. In this talk we give an overview of our own experience of moving
from Python as preferred code base to Rust. We will give examples of where Rust excels (and where it still lacks). We discuss
the emerging Rust scientific computing ecosystem, and present a deep dive into the Rust Linear Solver Toolbox, 
an under development Rust library for dense and sparse parallel linear algebra.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
