**This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience.** It uses plotting as its motivating example. Please note that this lesson uses Python 3.

This one-day course aims to answer the following questions:

How do I…

-     …read tabular data?
-     …plot a single vector of values?
-     …create a time series plot?
-     …create one plot for each of several data sets?
-     …get extra data from a single data set for plotting?
-     …write programs I can read and re-use in future?

#### Prerequisites:

1. Learners need to understand what files and directories are, what a working directory is, and how to start a Python interpreter.
1. Learners must install Python before the class starts.
1. Learners must get the gapminder data before class starts: please download and unzip the file [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip).
1. Please see [the setup instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup.html) for details.
