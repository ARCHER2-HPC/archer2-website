  		 <b> 2. Sea surface temperature (colour) and ice concentration (grey shades) in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge region.</b><br /><br />
			 		<i><strong>Dr Mattia Almansi, Marine Systems Modelling - National Oceoanography Centre</strong></i><br /><br /> 

  		 		 The video shows the evolution of sea surface temperature and ice concentration in an ocean simulation covering the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. It is one of the regional 1/36&degree; simulations that are guiding the implementation of high-resolution zooms in a global 1/12&degree; model. The ultimate goal is to improve the overflows of deep water masses. The optimal final configuration is expected to improve the performance of the global model for climate timescales (decadal and multi-decadal).  The simulation was designed and performed by the National Oceanography Centre as part of the IMMERSE project. The ocean general circulation model NEMO was run on the UK National Supercomputing Service Archer2.

          <b>3.&nbsp;Shock wave interaction with cavitation bubble.</b><br /><br />
             <i> <strong> Dr Panagiotis Tsoutsanis, Cranfield University</strong></i>  <br /><br /> 
             Interaction of a shock wave moving with Mach=2.4 and a gas-filled water bubble. These types of cavitation-bubbles can be found in several settings, ranging from our bloodstream to fuel droplets in hypersonic scramjet engines. Therefore, understanding the physical processes that occur during this interaction, can lead to more efficient targeted drug delivery, faster detection of neoplastic diseases through ultrasound imaging, and better protection from cavitation erosion and surface damage of hypersonic scramjet engines. The simulation was performed with the opensource freely available ucns3d software.

          <b>4.&nbsp;Turbulence structure in a supersonic mixing layer</b><br /><br />
             <i> <strong> Dr Jian Fang, Scientific Computing Department, STFC Daresbury Laboratory</strong></i>  <br /><br /> 
             The animation shows the turbulence coherent structures in a supersonic mixing layer. The turbulence is created in the shear layer between two high Mach number flows. The speed of the flow is so high that shocklets are generated due to the turbulence compressibility, and we see how the unsteady interaction between shocklets and vortical structure. The turbulence coherent structures are visualised with the iso-surfaces of swirling strength and coloured with streamwise vorticity. The shocklets are represented with the gradient of pressure. The results were obtained using ASTR code and the computing time is awarded by UKTC.

          <b>6.&nbsp;Evolution of a transient plasma structure</b><br /><br />
             <i> <strong> Mr George Holt, University of Strathclyde, Physics Department</strong></i>  <br /><br /> 
             Ultrashort lasers have been major drivers of discovery and innovation for the past several decades, and continue to be to this day. By colliding high-power laser pulses in plasma, the particles can be arranged into a fascinating range of three-dimensional patterns that have useful properties. They can be used to manipulate high-power laser beams, and as compact light sources. This video shows how an initially homogeneous plasma can evolve into an intricate structure. The data was generated using the EPOCH code deployed on ARCHER2, which has enabled exquisitely detailed, high-resolution simulations.
