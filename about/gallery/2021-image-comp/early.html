  		 <b> 2. Sea surface temperature (colour) and ice concentration (grey shades) in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge region.</b><br /><br />
			 		<!--  <i>Dr Mattia Almansi, NOC - MSM</i><br /><br /> -->


  		 		 The video shows the evolution of sea surface temperature and ice concentration in an ocean simulation covering the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. It is one of the regional 1/36&degree; simulations that are guiding the implementation of high-resolution zooms in a global 1/12&degree; model. The ultimate goal is to improve the overflows of deep water masses. The optimal final configuration is expected to improve the performance of the global model for climate timescales (decadal and multi-decadal).  The simulation was designed and performed by the National Oceanography Centre as part of the IMMERSE project. The ocean general circulation model NEMO was run on the UK National Supercomputing Service Archer2.

          <b>5.&nbsp;Acoustic field (yellow and blue) with overlapped velocity isosurface (red) obtained with a coupled LES-High order Acoustic coupled solver of an installed jet case</b><br /><br />
          <!--    <i> <strong> Dr Miguel Moratilla-Vega, Loughborough University/Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering Department</strong></i>  <br /><br /> -->
             The image reveals the interactions of jet turbulence and acoustic waves when the former is subject to a thin plate - a scenario often known as "installed" jets. High-frequency tones (yellow) as well as low-frequencies (blue) can be seen in the 3D rendering of the contour in the background. Jet turbulence is highlighted in red iso-surfaces in the foreground. 

The aim of the research (partially supported by ARCHER eCSE12-20 project) is to develop a fast interface for a high-order acoustic solver, to couple with finite volume Navier-Stokes equations codes that are widely used in the UK Turbulence, Applied Aerodynamics and ARCHER communities. Using a high-order acoustic solver significantly widens the range of the sound spectrum captured further afield, hence is potentially a highly reliable approach that can be used not only for exploring flow/acoustics physics but as a predictive design tool for noise reduction.

          <b>6.&nbsp;Evolution of a transient plasma structure</b><br /><br />
          <!--    <i> <strong> Mr George Holt, University of Strathclyde, Physics Department</strong></i>  <br /><br /> -->
             Ultrashort lasers have been major drivers of discovery and innovation for the past several decades, and continue to be to this day. By colliding high-power laser pulses in plasma, the particles can be arranged into a fascinating range of three-dimensional patterns that have useful properties. They can be used to manipulate high-power laser beams, and as compact light sources. This video shows how an initially homogeneous plasma can evolve into an intricate structure. The data was generated using the EPOCH code deployed on ARCHER2, which has enabled exquisitely detailed, high-resolution simulations.
