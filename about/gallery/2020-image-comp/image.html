  		 <b> 1. Metadynamics simulations opening the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease</b><br /><br />
  		 		 The main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an enzyme essential for virus replication through viral proteolytic activity and subsequent generation of infectious virus particles. Current computational efforts towards SARS-CoV-2 MPro inhibitor design have generally neglected an allosteric mechanism linked to His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad disruption and thus fail to target the open conformational state. We identify the rare event associated with the allosteric regulation of MPro activity in the orientation of the His41 imidazole side chain away from Cys145. In this video, we illustrate that molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations sample this allosteric mechanism within a computationally feasible timescale, to aid in performing computer-aided MPro inhibitor design.

  		 <b>2. The 'spike' of SARS-CoV-2 near the (100) surface of copper.  </b><br /><br />
  		 		 This research is about trying to understand the relationships between different material surfaces and virus'. The image is of the solvated spike protien of SARS-CoV-2 near the (100) surface of copper. It was generated with the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS and was post-processed using the visualisation software OVITO using ray tracing methods.

			   The lumen side of our blood vessel walls is covered by a tree-like structure called endothelial glycocalyx (EG). This image shows the EG conformation under blood flow conditions. In this research, a dissipative particle dynamics method is used to investigate the blood flow profile over the complex surface configuration with EG. All the simulations and post-processing are implemented on ARCHER.

  		 <b>9. Simulating coastal current separation  </b><br /><br />
			   A high-resolution ocean model simulation capturing current separation along the north-east coastline of 
				 the island of Rum, on the Scottish west coast. Panels A-F show simulated hourly sea surface temperature (SST) and 
				 current velocities during July 2019. The high-resolution simulation is nested within larger regional models (panel G) using 
				 the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). This was undertaken as part of the OffAqua project, which is evaluating 
				 the environmental conditions required for the development of offshore aquaculture.

  		 <b>11. Simulating coastal current separation across scales  </b><br /><br />
			   High-resolution ocean model simulations of sea surface temperature (SST) and current velocities, capturing 
				 current separation along the north-east coastline of the island of Rum, on the Scottish west coast. Each panel 
				 shows a different simulation using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) zoomed in on the Rum coastline 
				 around a fish farm. The resolution increases from left to right, with minimum element 
				 sizes of ~200 m (low resolution; panel A), ~30 m (panel B), and 5 m (highest resolution, panel C). The higher 
				 resolution simulations are nested within the lower resolution domains. As resolution increases, so does the 
				 emergence of new physical features in the flow, including coastal current separation events in the highest 
				 resolution domain (panel C). This was undertaken as part of the OffAqua project, which is evaluating the environmental 
				 conditions required for the development of offshore aquaculture.

  		 <b>13. Heat map of water on a Bassanite slab  </b><br /><br />
			   The calculated average structure of a Bassanite (Calcium Sulphate Hemihydrate) slab, along with the
				 calculated probability of finding a water oxygen atom at a given location on the surface and within the
				 structure itself.  The complex patterns appearing on the surface highlight local structuring of water on a 
				 scale inaccessible to experiments, but which can be obtained from atomistic simulations coupled with 
				 High-Performance Computers such as ARCHER.  Understanding the atomic scale behaviour of water and other
				 molecules at material surfaces has implications for a wide range of research areas including crystal growth and catalysis.

  		 <b>14. Particles surf on plasma waves excited by high-power lasers  </b><br /><br />
			   Particle accelerators are fundamental tools for science and society, enabling scientific discoveries and providing 
				 unprecedented insights into fundamental propterties of nature. Miniaturization of those machines would open the way 
				 to several applications, from light sources to cancer treatments. Laser wakefield acceleration is a promising candidate 
				 to achieve what is called a table-top electron accelerator. The idea is to use a powerful laser to excite a wave in a plasma, 
				 an ionized gas and exploit the strong accelerating fields of the wave to accelerate electrons. The picture depicts a laser 
				 pulse (in color) causing a strong modulation in the plasma density (in blue) and thus driving the plasma wave. An 
				 electron beam (witness bunch, in orange) is injected ito the latter and gets accelerated. The simulation has been performed with 
				 the Particle-In-Cell code OSIRIS on ARCHER in the framework of the HPC-Europa3 program.

  		 <b>17. Symmetric and anti-symmetric bypass transition induced by plamsa actuation  </b><br /><br />
			   Bypass transition in a boundary layer flow induced by a pair of DBD plamsa actuators is presented. By varying the distance between the two actuators, two forms of instabilities and subsequently the scenarios of transition, namely a symmetric one and an anti-symmetric one, are observed from Direct Numerical Simulations (large figures). These are confirmed by non-modal studies revealing the transient dynamics of  perturbations leading to the onset of transition (small figures)

  		 <b>18. Spatial evolution and dissipation levels of a wingtip vortex in an incompressible turbulent flow  </b><br /><br />
			   Some of the enduring enigmas and mysteries of turbulence are encoded in the high-order statistical moments which can be accessed solely through Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or advanced experimental techniques. The image shows a DNS simulation of a wingtip vortex where the instantaneous velocity field is visualized with the use of the Q-criterion through contour planes showing dissipation magnitudes of the turbulent flow along the streamwise direction. Using Archer's capability of 375 cores, a 30 million cells simulation has been performed with our group's in-house code PANTARHEI. This configuration represents a flow with a high level of anisotropy where the prevalence of the wingtip's vortical structure can be observed in detail. The understanding of the vortex evolution in terms of high-order statistics in the near wake region is of great importance for the improvement of civil aviation safety standards now with the introduction of unmanned aircraft and higher saturated airspace.
