  		 <b> 1. Metadynamics simulations opening the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease</b><br /><br />
  		 		 The main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an enzyme essential for virus replication through viral proteolytic activity and subsequent generation of infectious virus particles. Current computational efforts towards SARS-CoV-2 MPro inhibitor design have generally neglected an allosteric mechanism linked to His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad disruption and thus fail to target the open conformational state. We identify the rare event associated with the allosteric regulation of MPro activity in the orientation of the His41 imidazole side chain away from Cys145. In this video, we illustrate that molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations sample this allosteric mechanism within a computationally feasible timescale, to aid in performing computer-aided MPro inhibitor design.

  		 <b>3. In-situ visualisation at scale applied to Large Eddy Simulations in a heat exchanger tube bundle. Four mesh sizes are considered, going from 7 million cells (top left) to 3,391 millions cells (bottom right).</b><br /><br />
  		 		 High-fidelity turbulence simulations are performed in an elemental part of a heat exchanger tube bundle. The development of the flow is shown for 4 meshes of increasing size, each of the simulations being run using an optimal number of processors for the CFD software on ARCHER. The 4 animations that make the full video are obtained from frames generated on the fly by an in-situ visualisation library (catalyst) coupled with a solver (Code_Saturne). The largest simulation (bottom right animation) deals with an extremely large mesh of about 3.4 billion cells, and is run using about 90% of the full ARCHER (98,304 processors/4,096 nodes). The 151 generated frames  amount for about 50 megabytes of data. In comparison, traditional postprocessing relying on dumping data on disk would require about 4.5 terabytes of data, making them nearly impossible to be dealt with. ffmpeg is used to generate the final video.

  		 <b>4. Tip leakage loss generation in an axial compressor stator blade.</b><br /><br />
  		 		 The flow in an axial compressor that escapes through the clearance between the blade and rotating hub is known as the tip leakage flow. This video shows a radial and axial cut demonstrating the unsteady, turbulent nature of tip leakage flow in an axial compressor stator blade. Tip leakage flow accounts for up to 30% of loss in axial compressors. Loss which contributes to increased gas turbine fuel burn and therefore large environmental impact and cost, as gas turbines generate roughly 45% of UK energy. Entropy function is analogous to local lost work and dark blue areas, such as the flapping open separation in the tip gap, are high in loss. High fidelity computational fluid dynamics is a critical tool for building understanding of the flow behaviour as the complex phenomena are outside the scope of standard computational methods and geometric constraints make experimental measurements difficult.

  		 <b>6. Symmetric instability in a cross-equatorial western boundary current</b><br /><br />
  		 		Intense currents form on the western boundaries of Oceans - the North Brazil Current is one such example. The video shows the potential vorticity (PV) in an idealised model of this cross-equatorial current. PV is a measure of how fast and in which direction a fluid is rotating.
    Here we see anticyclonic (clockwise) eddies being spun up as the fluid crosses the equator. They have negative PV (shown in blue) and become symmetrically unstable. The instability generates small scale features within the eddies and sets their PV to zero (shown in white).
    The simulation is from work investigating how symmetric instability effects the North Brazil current. ARCHER was used to run the model - without it, it would not have been possible to resolve the small scale instabilities which make this work so interesting!

  		 <b>8. Laser pulse undergoing self-focusing effects during the penetration into the underdense frontal region of a pre-expanded plasma target.  </b><br /><br />
			   This movie depicts the electric field of an intense laser pulse (blue and red volumes) right before the laser is reflected by an overdense 
				 plasma (blue rear surface). The laser has penetrated the frontal underdense plasma region (transparent yellow), where it has 
				 coupled to the electrons heating them. Due to the collective non-linear effects of the plasma, the laser undergoes self-focusing 
				 within this underdense region. This is seen in the cross-section of the pulse (14 secs) where a clear pinching of the pulse is 
				 observed. This leads to an increase of the laser intensity on target, which in turn produces an enhanced electron heating. 
				 The simulation, performed with the Particle-In-Cell code OSIRIS on ARCHER, uses laser and plasma conditions modelled after 
				 the L3IA experiment at CNR (Pisa, Italy). This work is used to understand and improve the generation of hot electrons 
				 in laser-plasma interactions, vital for laser-plasma based ion acceleration.

  		 <b>10. Simulating coastal current separation across scales  </b><br /><br />
			   High-resolution ocean model simulations of sea surface temperature (SST) and current velocities, capturing 
				 current separation along the north-east coastline of the island of Rum, on the Scottish west coast. Each panel 
				 shows a different simulation using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) zoomed in on the Rum coastline 
				 around a fish farm. The resolution increases from left to right, with minimum element 
				 sizes of ~200 m (low resolution; panel A), ~30 m (panel B), and 5 m (highest resolution, panel C). The higher 
				 resolution simulations are nested within the lower resolution domains. As resolution increases, so does the 
				 emergence of new physical features in the flow, including coastal current separation events in the highest 
				 resolution domain (panel C). This was undertaken as part of the OffAqua project, which is evaluating the environmental 
				 conditions required for the development of offshore aquaculture.

  		 <b>12. Physiological Electro-mechanics Simulation on a Four-chamber Heart  </b><br /><br />
			   The video shows simulated electrical activation (left) and mechanical contraction (right) of the heart.  High-fidelity computational models of the heart are increasingly used to improve our understanding of human pathology and pathophysiology. Our research aims to build computer models for cardiac activation and contraction providing physiological activation and contraction dynamics. The simulation shown in the video includes fundamental features needed to simulate realistic cardiac function such as the Purkinje network (red network on the left), which leads to a fast activation of the bottom chambers of the heart,  and the effect of the pericardium, a 'bag' containing the heart and limiting its motion. With our models, we are able to simulate therapy delivery in order to improve patient selection and optimise response to treatment.

  		 <b>15. Plasmoids in magnetic reconnection: evolving towards bigger size  </b><br /><br />
			   Magnetic reconnection is a physical process occurring in plasma, the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the Universe. It entitles a re-arrangement of the plasma magnetic field topology with the release of magnetic energy. The process is ubiquitous in space, where it is at the origin of the northern lights or where it plays a role in eruptive phenomena like solar flares.
The video depicts the formation of magnetic islands or plasmoids: closed regions of magnetic field separated by reconnection points. With time these plasmoids attract each other and combine becoming bigger and bigger. The simulation has been performed with the Particle-In-Cell code ECsim on ARCHER. This work shed light on the evolution of reconnection from microscopic kinetic scales to macroscopic scales in perturbed and unperturbed current sheets. It thus helps to improve our understanding of the physics of the inner heliosphere.

  		 <b>16. Soot precursor benzene (C6H6) from a commercial jet fuel spray flame shown in a cross-section of a lab-scale burner  </b><br /><br />
			   Liquid fuels -- gasoline, diesel, and kerosene -- power most transportation. As the world begins to transition to lower-carbon fuel sources, we must do our best to reduce emissions from the fossil fuels which power our vehicles in the meantime. With Archer's computational power we can solve fluid mechanics and combustion chemistry equations to predict benzene (C6H6) production, a major species producing soot in flames used to power aircraft (benzene is shown in the gaseous field cross-section of a burner). Using detailed chemistry for liquid kerosene spray (shown as white droplets), we can adapt combustion models to predict soot and emission production from both conventional and alternative jet fuels at both stable and extreme in-flight operating conditions. These efforts will reduce emissions from aviation until fossil fuels are no longer needed for commercial flight.
