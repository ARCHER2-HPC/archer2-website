ARCHER2 has a series of policies designed to ensure we provide the best possible service to users. In particular, the aim is to provide a high quality service that is safe, accessible and inclusive.

These policies form an integrated whole, based on the Terms and Conditions of Access. They lay down both what we expect from Users, and how we will carry out the commitments we make to them in the Terms and Conditions. Policies will be reviewed on at least an annual basis and you will be asked to confirm you accepy policy changes annually.
