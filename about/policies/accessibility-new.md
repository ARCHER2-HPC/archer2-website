This accessibility statement applies to [www.archer2.ac.uk](www.archer2.ac.uk) and [https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/
](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/)
This website is run by EPCC on behalf of the ARCHER2 service partners. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, fonts and font sizes
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

EPCC is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

- links to videos on YouTube mostly use only automated captions

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

[Note: In this subsection, list:

- accessibility problems
- which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on
- when you plan to fix the problem

Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).]

Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).

We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.

Linked YouTube videos do not all have full manual transcripts and captions.  If you require a transcript of captions for a video please contact the  [ARCHER2 Service Desk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html).  We will consider your request and if possible, provide this for you.

### Disproportionate burden

Providing full manual transcript and captions for all videos would be excessively time consuming.  We are happy to try to provide these for individual videos on request.

#### Navigation and accessing information

We believe our site navigation is compliant

#### Interactive tools and transactions

We believe our site tools are compliant.

### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

We do not believe any content is not within scope.

#### PDFs and other documents

PDFs and other documents can be provided in alternative formats on request to the  [ARCHER2 Service Desk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html)

#### Live video

We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
