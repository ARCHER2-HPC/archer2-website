title: Website Accessibility Policy
summary: Committed to ensuring our websites are accessible to the widest possible audience, including disabled users.  
---

The long-term goal and intention of this policy is to state clear accessibility principles that ARCHER2 websites should follow.

The ARCHER2 team develops its website in line with the W3C recommended version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The ARCHER2 team acknowledges that this is an anticipatory and continuing work in progress and, in order to ensure no user is disadvantaged while this work is carried out, the ARCHER2 team intends to respond to all requests for assistance with accessibility by altering the necessary content as soon as possible. Appropriate channels of communication are available to allow visitors to give feedback about any accessibility issues.

The ARCHER2 team will make reasonable adjustments to ensure specific individual needs that cannot be addressed by mainstreamed adjustments are met.
