title: SAFE Acceptable Use Policy
summary:  
---

When you sign up to the SAFE you will need to agree to the following acceptable use policy.

*    Your use of SAFE and any HPC service you gain access to via SAFE must conform to the Janet acceptable use policy https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/acceptable-use-policy. Do not use them for any activity that may reasonably be regarded as unlawful or potentially so.
*    The HPC services will have their own acceptable use policies which you must also adhere to.
*    You may be required to review and accept the terms and conditions for the individual HPC services on an annual basis and your access to the associated accounts may be removed if you fail to do so.  
*    You should provide accurate information when registering with the SAFE and (while you remain a user of the system) keep this information up to date when your details change.
*    On an annual basis, you will be asked to verify your email address and other details which we hold in the SAFE. This process will be used to ensure that your details are current and that your account is still needed. You will be able to update or re-verify your details at any time. If 11 months go by without verification, we will send you a reminder. If we still do not hear from you after an additional month we will assume that your SAFE account has lapsed and is no longer required. If this occurs, then your associated machine accounts will be re-owned to the project concerned and may be re-allocated. If you subsequently wish to use ARCHER2 you can sign up for a new SAFE account or contact the [ ARCHER2 Service Desk]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/support-access/servicedesk).
*    Your SAFE account is for your personal use only, you should not allow others access to the account or to the credentials you use to log in. Keep your login credentials secure. If you have any reason to suspect these have been compromised, you should either contact us or change them immediately.
*    You should not have multiple active SAFE registrations at the same time. If this happens accidentally contact us and we will be able to merge the registrations.
*    Do not apply for HPC service access on behalf of other people.
*    Designated managers of your projects approve your membership and assign resources to you for use within the project. They can also lock, remove or re-own project accounts so you should not store data un-related to the project in these accounts. 
*    If you manage a project within the SAFE then, to allow you to do this, you will be given access to some personal data about members and applicants to the project. You are legally required to obey the relevant data protection legislation and not use this data for other purposes.

If you have any questions, please contact The [ ARCHER2 Service Desk]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/support-access/servicedesk).
