-     to respond promptly to any complaints or suggestions you make about the service

## You accept:

 -    that the service is provided "as is" and we can't guarantee 100% perfection. In legal terms, this means that we are excluding all warranties and conditions applying to the service, including those implied by law. What is this? We are not liable if things go wrong and you suffer damage as a result, although if our negligence results in anyone's death or personal injury we do not limit or exclude our liability for that.
-     that you are responsible for your use of any advice or information we may give you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that it's true and useful, but we can't guarantee this. In legal terms, this means that we expressly disclaim any and all liability for all representations, statements, conditions or warranties to that or any other effect except to the extent that such liability may not be lawfully excluded.
-     that we may make changes in the service
-     that we will use the personal details which you supply to us, together with records of your use of the service, as described in our [Personal Data and Privacy Policy](privacy.html)

-     that you alone are responsible for what you do when using the service. If you break the law you alone must answer for it, and if you cause damage to anyone else, you alone are liable, not us

-     that the use of the service by nationals of certain countries is controlled by special regulations laid down by the UK Government in connection with the [Wassenaar Arrangement](http://www.wassenaar.org/)
