## Code of Conduct (Summary View)

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in ARCHER2 events and training, using the ARCHER2 system and interacting via email or online platforms (e.g. Github) all people accept to abide by the ARCHER2 Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form or behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all activities, events and interactions:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to ARCHER2 Code of Conduct Committee by [completing this form](http://bit.ly/ARCHER-Training-Code-of-Conduct-Incident-Report), who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

## Code of Conduct (Detailed View)
### Part 1. Introduction

ARCHER2 values the involvement of everyone who engages and interacts with the service. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for people to work, interact and learn. All people involved with and interacting with each other and the service are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone involved with and interacting with the ARCHER2 service is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by ARCHER2 including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub and course chat pages. Event hosts and platform administrators are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

The ARCHER2 management team is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They can be contacted by emailing either:

- [Alan Simpson (ARCHER2 Service Director)](mailto:a.simpson@epcc.ed.ac.uk); or
- [Lorna Smith (ARCHER2 Deputy Service Director)](mailto:l.smith@epcc.ed.ac.uk).
 
All reports will be reviewed by managers and will be kept confidential.

### Part 2. ARCHER2 Code of Conduct

ARCHER2 is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our staff, or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, employment, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone involved in ARCHER2 is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by ARCHER2 including, but not limited to, the ARCHER2 machine, service desk, events, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub and course chat pages. By participating with the ARCHER2 service in any way, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which ARCHER2 resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

#### Part 2.1 Expected behaviour

All participants in our services, events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all ARCHER2 activities and platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

#### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants in any ARCHER2 activity or platform include:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* the display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* insults or put downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* excessive swearing
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* publication of private communication without consent

#### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any ARCHER2 platforms and activities, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage ARCHER2 management to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

### Reporting a Potential Code of Conduct Incident

If you believe someone violated the Code of Conduct on an ARCHER2 platform or activity we ask that you report it. You are encouraged to submit your report by completing the Code of Conduct Incident Report Form. The form may be completed anonymously, or you may include your contact information.

[Submit a Code of Conduct Incident Report](http://bit.ly/ARCHER-Training-Code-of-Conduct-Incident-Report)

ARCHER2 takes all incident reports seriously and will review all reports. A report guarantees review, but not necessarily that an action will be taken.
