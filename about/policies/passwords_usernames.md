For security reasons there are certain restrictions governing the choice of usernames and passwords on ARCHER2.

## Passwords

Password quality or strength will be assessed and controlled such that we can support both complex, shorter passwords and long but comparatively simple passwords. For example both “LA10!£lsty” and “horsebatterystaple” would be supported.

This flexibility is supported by offering users “credits” against the minimum length of the password, allowing a password to be shorter by one character for each “credit” offered for using a different character type. 

For ARCHER2:
* A minimum password length of 18 is set.
* 2 credits are made available for using lower case letter characters.
* 2 credits are made available for using upper case letter characters.
* 2 credits are made available for using numerical characters.
* 2 credits are made available for using punctuation characters.

This will in effect create a minimum password length which will vary between 10-16 characters depending on number of types of character used.

Additionally:
* A minimum of 5 characters from a new password must not be present in the old password.
* There will be no requirement to use multiple character types.
* A maximum of 2 consecutive identical characters will be permitted.
* A dictionary check will be applied to verify that the password is not composed of or based upon a single word.


## Usernames

Usernames are standardised and the rules governing them are:
* Must be a maximum of 31 characters in length
* Only alpha-numeric characters, underscore and hyphen allowed (no special charcters eg $,@)
* Lowercase only
* Must start with a letter
* Must not be the same as a groupname on ARCHER2
