- Although it is not a legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor spaces, we encourage you to wear a face covering unless seated, eating, or drinking. The Scottish Government strongly recommends that you continue to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, see <https://www.gov.scot/news/use-of-face-coverings/>
- Please be conscious of giving people space, and observe the Distance Aware scheme: <https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-distance-aware-scheme/>
- Maintain good hand hygiene: washing hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, available at the entrance of the room.
- Please do not attend face-to-face training if
    - you have any [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/),
    - you've tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week,
    - you've been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 in the past week.
