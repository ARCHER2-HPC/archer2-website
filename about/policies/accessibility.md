# Website Accessibility policy

The ARCHER2 team is committed to ensuring that its websites are accessible to the widest possible audience, including disabled users.

## The ARCHER2 website accessibility policy
### Policy intention

The long-term goal and intention of this policy is to state clear accessibility principles that ARCHER2 websites should follow.

The ARCHER2 team develops its website in line with the W3C recommended version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The ARCHER2 team acknowledges that this is an anticipatory and continuing work in progress and, in order to ensure no user is disadvantaged while this work is carried out, the ARCHER2 team intends to respond to all requests for assistance with accessibility by altering the necessary content as soon as possible. Appropriate channels of communication are available to allow visitors to give feedback about any accessibility issues.

The ARCHER2 team will make reasonable adjustments to ensure specific individual needs that cannot be addressed by mainstreamed adjustments are met.

### Policy dimensions

For the purpose of this policy, the term "websites" includes:

*    Websites (public and non authenticated) managed and under the control of the ARCHER2 team using the archer2.ac.uk domain (www.archer2.ac.uk/something).
*    Material managed and hosted by the ARCHER2 team on these pages such as documents, audio, video and any other additional files.

### Policy principles

The ARCHER2 team will adhere to the following principles in relation to its websites:

*    The websites shall provide appropriate channels of communication for feedback about accessibility.
*    The websites shall meet the ARCHER2 team's responsibilities under the Equality Act (2010) and The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2012.
