The ARCHER2 hardware is provided by a Cray EX supercomputer system that was procured from Cray. In late 2019, Cray was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). There are two HPE teams directly involved in supporting the ARCHER2 service. The on-site support team is based at the ACF and manages hardware and system software support on a 7×24 basis, liaising closely with EPCC and the HPE Centre of Excellence team to provide comprehensive support for the user community. The Centre of Excellence (CoE) supports the ARCHER2 service by providing, for example, in-depth support accessed through helpdesk channels, tailored training, and specific community support.</p>
